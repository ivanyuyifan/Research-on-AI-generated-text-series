This article introduces a novel, organic approach to measuring syntactic complexity in second language (L2) writing, grounded in systemic functional linguistics. Unlike traditional clause-based metrics, the proposed measure evaluates complexity by assessing the interrelated nature of syntactic features across multiple levels of structure. Drawing on a corpus of English essays written by L2 learners with varying proficiency levels, the study compares the new metric with established measures such as T-units and clause ratios. Findings demonstrate that the organic measure better captures developmentally sensitive differences in learner writing, particularly among intermediate and advanced groups. It also correlates more strongly with independent proficiency ratings. The study argues that syntactic complexity is a multidimensional construct that cannot be fully captured through decontextualized clause counts. This organic measure provides a more nuanced and theoretically grounded tool for assessing syntactic development, offering implications for both L2 writing assessment and instructional design. The research contributes to the evolving landscape of complexity measurement by aligning with functional views of language and emphasizing the need for integrated, meaning-sensitive analytic tools.
