This article critically examines the evolving concept of the “intercultural” within applied linguistics and language education research. It challenges static, essentialist views of culture by advocating for a dynamic, relational understanding rooted in poststructuralist and decolonial perspectives. Drawing on examples from classroom discourse, ethnography, and teacher education, the author argues that interculturality emerges through situated, embodied, and power-laden interactions shaped by histories of colonialism, language hierarchies, and social inequalities. The paper calls for methodological reflexivity in intercultural research, emphasizing the importance of engaging with participants’ lived experiences and epistemologies. By foregrounding voice, positionality, and context, the article encourages a reorientation of intercultural studies toward more ethical and transformative educational practices.
