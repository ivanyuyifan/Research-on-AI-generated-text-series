This article reviews longitudinal research exploring the dynamic development of syntactic complexity and accuracy in second language (L2) speech. Grounded in Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST), it synthesizes case studies that trace individual learners' trajectories over extended periods. The review highlights non-linear, idiosyncratic growth patterns, characterized by variability, plateaus, and regressions, rather than uniform progress. It emphasizes that complexity and accuracy do not develop in parallel but interact in intricate, often unpredictable ways. Methodologically, the reviewed studies employ time-series analysis, minâ€“max graphs, and phase portraits to visualize learner-specific dynamics. The findings challenge static, group-level models of L2 development and underscore the necessity of temporally fine-grained, individualized approaches. The article calls for increased adoption of dynamic methodologies and a rethinking of pedagogical expectations regarding language learning trajectories. It contributes to a growing body of literature advocating for complexity-informed perspectives in second language acquisition research.
