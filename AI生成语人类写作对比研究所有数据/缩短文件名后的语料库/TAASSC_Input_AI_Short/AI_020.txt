This article introduces the concept of "supralingualism" to critique the global translation industry’s underlying ideologies and practices. It examines how translatability is not a neutral or purely linguistic process, but one shaped by market-driven assumptions of equivalence, standardization, and cultural hierarchy. Drawing from case studies and discourse analysis, the author argues that supralingualism promotes a commodified view of language that privileges efficiency, transparency, and extractability, often at the expense of linguistic diversity and cultural specificity. The paper reveals how the industry’s push for scalable, algorithm-friendly translations marginalizes non-dominant languages and epistemologies, reinforcing global inequalities. By interrogating the political economy of translation, the article calls for a more critical and ethical engagement with multilingualism that resists the depoliticizing effects of the translatability regime.
