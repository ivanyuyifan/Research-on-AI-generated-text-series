This study investigates the types and purposes of multimodal writing tasks assigned in undergraduate university courses across disciplines in the United States. Drawing on 161 syllabi and interviews with seven instructors, we identify 104 multimodal tasks that integrate linguistic and nonlinguistic modes. Tasks were categorized into disciplinary expression—emphasizing genre conventions—and creative expression—promoting rhetorical flexibility. Most tasks required written or spoken language alongside visuals (e.g., slides, posters), and individual authorship was prevalent. Findings highlight the dual role of multimodal tasks in fostering academic literacy and creativity, while underscoring the need for explicit scaffolding to support L2 learners.
