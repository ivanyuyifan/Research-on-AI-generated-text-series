This review explores how community feedback contributes to doctoral studentsâ€™ development as academic writers within the framework of doctoral apprenticeship. Drawing on qualitative data from two case studies of international doctoral candidates in Education, the study examines how interactions with supervisors, peers, and wider academic communities support the acquisition of genre knowledge and disciplinary writing practices. The findings highlight the centrality of dialogic feedback in fostering rhetorical awareness, disciplinary enculturation, and writer identity. Supervisory feedback played a foundational role, but peer and community feedback were also instrumental in facilitating writing progress and reflective learning. The study emphasizes the social and situated nature of doctoral writing development, advocating for broader conceptions of feedback that include informal, collaborative, and community-based exchanges. These insights suggest that cultivating diverse feedback networks can enhance doctoral writing support and reinforce the relational dimensions of academic literacy development.
