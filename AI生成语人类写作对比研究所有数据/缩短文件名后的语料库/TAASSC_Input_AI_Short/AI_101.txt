This study investigates English as a foreign language (EFL) writing competences among students in upper secondary academic track schools in Switzerland and Germany. Using a longitudinal design, the research assessed students' performance in both argumentative and source-based writing tasks over an eight-month interval. Results show that most students reached the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) level B2—a key requirement for tertiary education—by their penultimate school year, with modest gains observed across the study period. Argumentative writing outperformed source-based writing, likely due to higher curricular familiarity. Gender and language background had no significant effect on writing development, whereas general cognitive ability showed a positive association. Differences in writing performance between the two countries were attributable to the selectivity of their school systems. The findings suggest that while average writing proficiency meets expected standards, students below B2 early on show limited progress, highlighting the need for targeted pedagogical support. Implications for curriculum design and teacher training are discussed.
