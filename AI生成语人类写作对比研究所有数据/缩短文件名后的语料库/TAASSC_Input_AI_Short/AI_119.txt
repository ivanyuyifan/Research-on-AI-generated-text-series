This study investigates how modality—video vs. text—affects the interpersonal stance of instructor feedback in ESL writing. Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics and the APPRAISAL framework, we analyzed 136 instances of formative feedback from three instructors across two university ESL courses. Using ATTITUDE analysis, we examined AFFECT, APPRECIATION, and JUDGMENT, alongside GRADUATION (intensity). Results show that text feedback was significantly more negative (73% vs. 47%) and more likely to criticize student text, while video feedback offered a more balanced tone, with more praise and mitigated criticism. Logistic regression confirmed that mode—not instructor or assignment—was the strongest predictor of negative evaluation. Video feedback also elicited more affective language and suggestions, fostering a more supportive tone. These findings underscore how modality shapes relational dynamics and recommend screencasting as a tool for enhancing interpersonal rapport in digital feedback.
