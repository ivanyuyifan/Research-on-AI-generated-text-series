This article investigates how multi-ethnic minority students in Hong Kong navigate intersecting ideologies of language, race, and identity within the context of Chinese-medium education. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and discourse analysis, the study explores students’ experiences of inclusion, exclusion, and identity negotiation in everyday school interactions. It reveals how racialized language ideologies—particularly the assumption that Chinese language competence is tied to ethnic Chineseness—shape perceptions of belonging and academic legitimacy. Students often encounter surprise or skepticism when their language proficiency challenges dominant expectations. The findings highlight how institutional practices and peer interactions reinforce racialized boundaries, while students engage in complex strategies to assert their place in the educational and linguistic landscape. The study contributes to understanding how racial and linguistic hierarchies operate in multilingual societies and calls for more equitable language policies in education.
