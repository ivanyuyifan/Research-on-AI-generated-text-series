This review article explores assessment practices in digital multimodal composing (DMC) within second language (L2) writing and proposes a process-oriented framework for evaluating learner performance. While DMC has gained prominence in L2 education—encompassing modes such as video, image, sound, and text—its assessment remains under-theorized. Drawing on sociocultural and multiliteracies perspectives, the authors analyze current approaches and identify key gaps, including the overemphasis on final products and lack of attention to composing processes. The proposed framework outlines four recursive dimensions: ideation, orchestration, production, and dissemination, emphasizing learner agency, collaboration, and reflection throughout. It also integrates both formative and summative assessment components. The study underscores the need for rubrics that capture multimodal creativity and digital literacy alongside linguistic accuracy. By reconceptualizing assessment through a dynamic, process-sensitive lens, this review advances pedagogical and research agendas in L2 writing and multiliteracies development. Implications are offered for instructors, curriculum designers, and policymakers aiming to align assessment practices with 21st-century communicative competencies.
