This study explores how testimonial justice can be achieved through community-based and patient-centered outcomes research (CBPR/PCOR) with Spanish-speaking populations in the U.S. Drawing on engagement sessions with primarily Latina stakeholders, the research highlights systemic health inequities shaped by language barriers, cultural stereotypes, and limited provider competence. The findings identify four key areas—gender roles, sociocultural dynamics, interpreting modalities, and health literacy—through which Spanish speakers experience epistemic injustice in healthcare. By centering patient testimonios, the study reveals how Latina participants challenge passivity and assert agency in medical encounters, often taking on the invisible labor of communication within their families. The research advocates for a shift from deficit-based models to frameworks recognizing patients’ communicative strengths, emphasizing applied linguistics as a tool for promoting social justice, enhancing provider health literacy, and designing more inclusive healthcare systems.
