This study investigates the impact of a professional development (PD) program on the beliefs of Vietnamese EFL teachers regarding oral corrective feedback (CF). The PD program included a workshop and experiential and reflective activities. Ten experienced EFL teachers participated in pre- and post-intervention interviews, reflective journals, peer observations, and self-video-recorded lesson reflections. The results show that the teachers' beliefs about the importance and necessity of CF remained positive but became more sophisticated. They reported paying more attention to CF provision, considering various contextual factors, and using a broader range of CF types, especially output-prompting CF. The teachers also became more comfortable with immediate CF for both fluency and accuracy work. Beliefs about CF sources evolved, with some teachers placing more trust in peer correction. The study highlights the effectiveness of experiential and reflective activities in reshaping teachers' beliefs about CF. The findings suggest that PD programs combining workshops with reflective practice can significantly influence teachers' beliefs and practices regarding CF, even in contexts with limited resources. Future research should explore the impact of similar PD programs on novice teachers and in different educational settings.
