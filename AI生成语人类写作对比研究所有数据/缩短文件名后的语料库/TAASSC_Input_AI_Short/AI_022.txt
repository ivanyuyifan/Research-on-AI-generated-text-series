This article introduces the concept of cultural translation as a critical lens for understanding language, identity, and diversity in the era of globalization. It traces the evolution of cultural translation from its roots in translation studies, anthropology, and intercultural communication to its current relevance in applied linguistics. The authors argue that traditional models of translation focused on equivalence are inadequate in addressing the complexities of global communication, where cultural meanings are negotiated across ideological, historical, and political boundaries. Central to the discussion is the distinction between diversity and difference, and the role of the “Third Space” in enabling hybrid, transformative identities. Drawing on contributions to a special issue, the paper explores how overt, covert, and translanguaging practices reveal tensions between commodified diversity and untranslatable cultural difference. Ultimately, it calls for an ethical approach to cultural translation that acknowledges symbolic power, challenges monolingual ideologies, and embraces the fluid, contested nature of meaning-making in multilingual, multicultural contexts.
