This article explores how artists’ statements and instructional “how-to” guides contribute to the conceptualisation and legitimation of creative practice within institutional and public contexts. Through a critical discourse analysis of artist-authored texts and professional development literature, the study examines how these genres frame artistic identity, process, and value. The findings reveal that such texts often construct a normative image of the professional artist—articulate, reflective, and strategically positioned within market and academic systems. While artist statements serve to contextualize creative work, they also function as gatekeeping mechanisms, shaping how art is perceived, evaluated, and consumed. Similarly, “how-to” materials codify creative processes, often reinforcing neoliberal values such as productivity, self-promotion, and entrepreneurialism. The article argues that these textual practices play a formative role in defining what counts as legitimate creative labor, raising questions about authenticity, access, and power in contemporary art worlds.
