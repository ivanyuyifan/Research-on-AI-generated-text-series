This review explores the concept of learner empowerment in second and foreign language education, synthesizing research on autonomy, agency, and engagement. It highlights how empowering pedagogical practices—such as task-based learning, self-assessment, and participatory decision-making—can enhance learners’ motivation, confidence, and investment in language learning. Drawing from sociocultural and critical pedagogical frameworks, the article emphasizes the importance of creating learning environments that support voice, choice, and meaningful participation. Empirical studies reviewed show that when learners are positioned as active agents rather than passive recipients, they develop greater self-regulation and linguistic competence. The review also addresses challenges to empowerment, including institutional constraints and teacher beliefs, and offers strategies for integrating empowerment into curriculum design and classroom practice. Ultimately, the paper argues for a shift toward more democratic and learner-centered approaches that recognize the diverse identities and aspirations of language learners.
