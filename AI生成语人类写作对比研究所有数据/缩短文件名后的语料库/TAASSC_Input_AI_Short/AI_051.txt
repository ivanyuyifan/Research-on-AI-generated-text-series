This article explores the rhetorical strategies used to establish topic significance in the introductory sections of reports on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Drawing on a corpus of published RCT reports in medical journals, the study applies a genre-based and discourse-analytic approach to examine how authors persuade readers of the relevance and urgency of their research. The analysis identifies a range of persuasive strategies, including appeals to prevalence and severity of conditions, gaps in existing literature, public health impact, and cost-effectiveness. These strategies are often realized through specific lexico-grammatical patterns and evaluative language. The findings reveal a consistent structure that aligns with the problem-justification framework, while also showing variation influenced by disciplinary subfields and target readership. The study contributes to our understanding of scientific argumentation and offers practical insights for academic writing instruction, particularly for novice researchers in health sciences aiming to publish in high-impact journals.
