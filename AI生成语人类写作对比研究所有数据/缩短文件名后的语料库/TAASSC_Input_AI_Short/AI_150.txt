This study investigates the sources of speech anxiety in Chinese as a second language (L2) using structural equation modeling (SEM). It examines how linguistic (speech proficiency) and extra-linguistic (speech self-efficacy, speaking strategies, willingness-to-communicate [WTC], and socio-cultural attitudes) factors influence L2 Chinese speech anxiety. Data were collected from 226 L2 Chinese learners at two universities in Beijing through a questionnaire and a speaking proficiency test. The results showed that speaking strategies were the most significant direct predictor of speech anxiety, while WTC, speaking self-efficacy, and speaking proficiency were negative predictors. Socio-cultural attitudes indirectly influenced speech anxiety through WTC. The study highlights the importance of considering both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors in understanding L2 speech anxiety and suggests that reducing anxiety may involve enhancing learners' WTC, self-efficacy, and proficiency, as well as fostering positive socio-cultural attitudes. Future research should explore the development of more comprehensive scales for measuring L2 speaking anxiety and consider the impact of language distance and dialogical aspects of speech in larger and more diverse samples.
