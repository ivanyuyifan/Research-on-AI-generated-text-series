This study explores how future L2 writing selves—ideal and ought—predict EFL learners’ emotions, motivation, and achievement. Drawing on the 2×2 model of L2 self-guides and data from 85 Iranian university students, we found that ideal L2 writing self positively predicted enjoyment, motivation, and course grades, while ought L2 writing self predicted anxiety and motivation. Enjoyment mediated the ideal self–motivation link; anxiety mediated the ought self–motivation path and negatively mediated ideal self–achievement. These findings affirm the qualitative differences in motivational sources and their emotional and academic consequences, highlighting the need for promotion-focused instructional strategies in L2 writing contexts.
