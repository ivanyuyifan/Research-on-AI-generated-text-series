This study investigates the rhetorical and linguistic characteristics of figure legends in scientific research articles using a corpus-driven approach. Analyzing a specialized corpus of legends from high-impact journals across disciplines, the authors examine their structural patterns, lexical features, and functional roles within the broader discourse of scientific reporting. The findings reveal that figure legends serve not only as descriptive labels but also as compressed sites of scientific argumentation, often incorporating methodological detail, result summaries, and evaluative language. Despite disciplinary variation, common patterns include passive constructions, technical terminology, and multimodal referencing. The study emphasizes the pedagogical and communicative importance of figure legends, highlighting their role in supporting data interpretation and enhancing textual coherence. It argues for the inclusion of figure legend analysis in scientific writing instruction, particularly for novice researchers and multilingual scholars. By shedding light on an understudied genre component, this research contributes to academic literacy and genre-based pedagogy in science communication.
