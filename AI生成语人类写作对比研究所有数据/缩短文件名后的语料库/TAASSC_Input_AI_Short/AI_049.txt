This article examines the role of regulative discourse in peer reviewer feedback on research manuscripts written by L2 (second language) English users. Using a corpus-based discourse analysis of review comments from applied linguistics journals, the study investigates how reviewers use language to guide, evaluate, and legitimize academic writing practices. The analysis focuses on recurring linguistic patterns that function to position authors within disciplinary norms—particularly through conditional statements, hedging, and appeals to methodological standards. Findings reveal how reviewers’ feedback serves not only as textual critique but also as a mechanism of epistemic socialization, subtly reinforcing dominant ideologies of academic rigor, data sufficiency, and scholarly legitimacy. The paper argues that such regulative discourse can be both supportive and exclusionary, depending on its alignment with the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of L2 authors. The study contributes to scholarship on academic literacy, peer review practices, and the sociopolitical dimensions of scholarly communication in multilingual settings.
