This article examines how academic writers engage with readers in English-language research articles, focusing on cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and authorial positional variations. Using a corpus-based analysis of research articles from multiple disciplines and national contexts, the study investigates the use of engagement strategies—such as questions, directives, personal pronouns, and reader references—that construct a dialogic relationship between writer and reader. The findings reveal significant variation in engagement practices depending on disciplinary norms, cultural rhetorical traditions, and the authors’ geographic and institutional affiliations. Humanities texts tended to show higher reader engagement than those in hard sciences, while cultural differences influenced preferences for direct or indirect interaction. Additionally, non-native English-speaking authors often adopted more cautious or distanced rhetorical strategies. The study highlights the importance of understanding engagement as a socially and culturally situated practice, with implications for academic writing pedagogy, especially for English as an Additional Language (EAL) scholars aiming to publish internationally.
