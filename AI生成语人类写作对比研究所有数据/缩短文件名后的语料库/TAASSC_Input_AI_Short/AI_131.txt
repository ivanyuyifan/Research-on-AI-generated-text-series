This qualitative study explored the dynamic interplay of demotivation and remotivation among 40 advanced Chinese EFL learners in Hong Kong. Using motivational-change graphs and collaborative snowball tasks, participants traced their motivation from kindergarten to postgraduate studies and identified key demotivators and remotivating strategies. Findings revealed that teacher-related factors—especially grammar-focused, teacher-centred methods and authoritarian personalities—were the most salient external demotivators, while internal factors such as lack of confidence and perceived low English necessity also contributed. Remotivation was fostered by learner-centred activities, updated materials, supportive teacher–parent relationships, and the cultivation of an ideal L2 self. The study underscores the need for pedagogical shifts towards autonomy-supportive, engaging practices and provides actionable guidelines for teacher educators and policymakers.
