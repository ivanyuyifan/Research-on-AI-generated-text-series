This article critically examines the concept of “fit” in academic hiring, proposing a reconceptualization grounded in sociocultural and institutional perspectives. Drawing on interview data from academic hiring committee members and administrators across disciplines, the study explores how fit is interpreted, enacted, and justified in recruitment processes. The findings reveal that fit is a multifaceted and often ambiguous construct, shaped by disciplinary norms, departmental culture, institutional priorities, and implicit biases. Rather than a fixed criterion, fit operates as a rhetorical and relational device used to align candidate profiles with perceived organizational needs and values. The study highlights the potential for fit-based reasoning to obscure structural inequalities and limit diversity in academia. The authors argue for greater transparency and reflexivity in hiring practices, advocating for an expanded understanding of fit that embraces pluralism, equity, and inclusion. This research contributes to higher education studies and hiring policy discourse, offering insights for more equitable academic recruitment strategies.
