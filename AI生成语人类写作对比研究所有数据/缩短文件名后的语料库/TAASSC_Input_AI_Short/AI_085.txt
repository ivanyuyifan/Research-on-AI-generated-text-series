This article explores the application of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) in the design and delivery of English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP) modules, with a focus on rethinking the notion of a transferable academic “common core.” Through a critical review of current EGAP practices and the theoretical lens of SFL, the author argues for a more nuanced understanding of academic language as shaped by discipline-specific purposes and social contexts. SFL’s metafunctional framework—ideational, interpersonal, and textual—is proposed as a powerful tool for analyzing and teaching the linguistic features of academic texts. The study illustrates how SFL-informed pedagogy can help learners better understand academic genres and make informed language choices. It challenges the assumption that generalized academic skills can fully prepare students for disciplinary study and advocates for pedagogical approaches that bridge general and specific academic literacies. This work contributes to EAP curriculum development by proposing a principled and functional foundation for EGAP instruction grounded in language-in-use.
