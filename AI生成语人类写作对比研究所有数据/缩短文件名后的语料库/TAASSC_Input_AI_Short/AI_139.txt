This bibliometric study maps the evolution of ‘trans-’ scholarship on writing from 2011-2020 by analysing 165 peer-reviewed articles. Key findings reveal Suresh Canagarajah and Bruce Horner as the most cited scholars, with Canagarajah’s 2013 Translingual Practice and Horner et al.’s 2011 College English article as pivotal texts. Among 20 tracked concepts, “translingual practice” and “translingual pedagogy” rose significantly, while “translingual writing,” “code-meshing,” and “monolingualism” declined. The study highlights a conceptual shift from linguistic hybridity to spatial repertoires and underscores growing pedagogical applications, while noting ongoing debates over definitions and power relations in translingual approaches.
