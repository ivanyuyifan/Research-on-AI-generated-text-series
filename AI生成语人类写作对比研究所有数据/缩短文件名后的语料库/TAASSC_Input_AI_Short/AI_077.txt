This study critiques the limitations of form-focused English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction and advocates for a meaning-centered, discourse-informed approach grounded in authentic disciplinary texts. Drawing from a Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) context, the authors examine how conditional logic—often oversimplified in EAP grammar resources—is expressed across disciplines such as Political Science, Psychology, Physics, and Economics. The paper argues that reliance on formulaic “if-clauses” in conventional teaching materials inadequately prepares students for the diverse linguistic realizations of logic found in academic discourse. Through textual analysis and pedagogical examples, the authors demonstrate how conditionals manifest in nominalizations, imperatives, and alternative clause structures. They propose task designs that enhance learners’ comprehension and productive skills by focusing on underlying meaning rather than surface grammar. This reconceptualization aims to bridge the gap between grammar instruction and the complex language demands of university study, ultimately equipping students with the tools to interpret and produce nuanced academic texts.
