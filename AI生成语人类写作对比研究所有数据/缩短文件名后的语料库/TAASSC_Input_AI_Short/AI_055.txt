This study investigates temporal changes in the macrostructural organization of doctoral dissertations in applied linguistics over a 30-year period. Using a diachronic corpus of dissertations from the 1980s to the 2010s, the research analyzes how the conventional structure and rhetorical staging of these academic texts have evolved. The analysis focuses on key sections such as the Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, and Discussion, examining shifts in length, ordering, and functional emphasis. Findings reveal a trend toward increased standardization of the IMRD (Introduction–Method–Results–Discussion) format, along with growing prominence of metadiscourse and authorial presence. These changes reflect broader academic and institutional pressures toward research transparency, publishability, and internationalization. The study contributes to our understanding of disciplinary writing development and has pedagogical implications for academic writing instruction, particularly in preparing doctoral students to meet evolving genre expectations.
