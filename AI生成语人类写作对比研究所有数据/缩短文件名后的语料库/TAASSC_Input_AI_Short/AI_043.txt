This study investigates the challenges faced by second language (L2) postgraduate students in academic writing within engineering disciplines, incorporating perspectives from both students and faculty members. Using a mixed-methods approach involving interviews and surveys, the research identifies key areas of difficulty, including discipline-specific genre conventions, lexical precision, argumentation, and coherence. Faculty members often perceive L2 students' writing as lacking clarity or depth, while students report limited feedback and uncertainty about academic expectations. The findings highlight a mismatch between institutional support and actual learner needs, suggesting that generic writing instruction fails to address the nuanced demands of engineering discourse. The study advocates for more tailored, discipline-specific writing support and increased collaboration between language specialists and engineering faculty. It contributes to applied linguistics and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) by offering insights into the sociocultural and epistemological dimensions of academic writing in STEM contexts.
