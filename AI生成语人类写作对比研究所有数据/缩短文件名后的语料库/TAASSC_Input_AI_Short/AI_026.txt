This article revisits the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis by examining how language influences thought and behavior in naturalistic human interactions. Moving beyond experimental paradigms, the study analyzes real-world conversational data to assess linguistic relativity in everyday contexts. Drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, the authors investigate how speakers of different languages orient to culturally and linguistically specific categories during interaction. The findings show that linguistic structures—such as grammatical gender, evidentiality, and spatial reference—shape not only how information is expressed but also how it is interpreted and acted upon in social settings. By grounding the Whorfian perspective in empirical interactional data, the paper demonstrates that language and cognition are dynamically co-constructed in context. This approach contributes to a nuanced understanding of linguistic relativity and highlights the value of studying language in use.
