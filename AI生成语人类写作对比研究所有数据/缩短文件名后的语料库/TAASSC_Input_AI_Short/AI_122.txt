This review examines the diachronic development of how language learning has been explicitly defined and implicitly conceptualized in applied linguistics research from the 1980s to the 2010s. Drawing on a corpus of academic journal articles, the study analyzes both overt definitions and underlying metaphors used to describe language learning processes. Results reveal a shift from behaviorist and cognitive models toward more sociocultural, ecological, and identity-based perspectives over time. While early studies emphasized input, acquisition, and individual cognition, more recent work foregrounds interaction, context, and learner agency. The analysis also uncovers persistent tensions between theoretical innovation and definitional clarity, with many studies lacking explicit definitions despite adopting novel frameworks. By tracing conceptual trends and identifying evolving metaphorical framings, this review contributes to a deeper understanding of disciplinary change and theoretical development in applied linguistics. It calls for greater reflexivity and definitional precision in future research to enhance conceptual coherence and interdisciplinary dialogue.
