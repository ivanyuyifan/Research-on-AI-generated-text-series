This article explores the perspectives and instructional practices of two Chinese English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teachers in delivering graduate-level research writing courses. Drawing on classroom observations, interviews, and teaching materials, the study investigates how the teachers navigate institutional expectations, student needs, and their own pedagogical beliefs in shaping writing instruction. The findings reveal that both teachers emphasize the importance of genre awareness, rhetorical structure, and critical thinking, but differ in how they balance explicit instruction with student autonomy. Their approaches are also shaped by contextual factors such as curriculum design, assessment demands, and perceptions of studentsâ€™ English proficiency. The study highlights the tensions between standardized writing models and flexible, student-centered pedagogy in EAP instruction. It contributes to research on teacher cognition in academic writing education and offers implications for supporting teacher development in multilingual, graduate-level contexts.
