This article examines how racialized students navigate educational pathways toward Catalan higher education, focusing on the structural and institutional barriers they face. Drawing on ethnographic data from two secondary schools and interviews with students, teachers, and counselors, the study reveals how racialization processes shape academic expectations, language ideologies, and institutional practices. The authors demonstrate that despite official discourses of inclusion and meritocracy, systemic inequalities persist through differential tracking, linguistic discrimination, and the devaluation of studentsâ€™ cultural and linguistic repertoires. These mechanisms hinder racialized students' access to post-compulsory education and university. The paper calls for a rethinking of educational equity, emphasizing the need for anti-racist practices and policies that acknowledge and confront the sociolinguistic and racial hierarchies embedded within the Catalan education system.
