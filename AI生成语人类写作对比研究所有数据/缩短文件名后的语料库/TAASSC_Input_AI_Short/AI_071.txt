This article explores the integration of learner-initiated research agendas into English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teaching through Exploratory Practice (EP). Responding to institutional changes in English proficiency requirements, the author presents a twelve-week EAP module designed to support international undergraduates by fostering personalized inquiry into their language learning challenges. Using Potentially Exploitable Pedagogic Activities (PEPAs), students formulated and explored their own “puzzles” to better understand and address their academic English needs. Findings indicate that this approach enhanced learner engagement, critical thinking, and reflection, while also informing curriculum development and improving teacher understanding of student needs. The study underscores the value of EP for sustainable, learner-centered pedagogy in EAP.
