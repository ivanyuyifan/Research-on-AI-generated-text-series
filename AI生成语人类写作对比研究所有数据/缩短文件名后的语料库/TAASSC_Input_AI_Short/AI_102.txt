This review explores the interrelationships among cognitive, affective, and metacognitive strategies in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing. Drawing on a synthesis of existing empirical studies, it highlights how these strategy domains collectively influence writing performance. Cognitive strategies, such as planning and text generation, directly support writing tasks, while affective strategies manage emotions and motivation. Metacognitive strategies, including self-monitoring and evaluation, regulate the use of both cognitive and affective strategies. Evidence suggests that successful EFL writers employ a balanced and dynamic combination of these strategies. Moreover, the interplay among them is mediated by contextual factors like proficiency level, writing task type, and instructional support. The review emphasizes the need for integrated strategy instruction in EFL classrooms to foster learner autonomy and writing competence. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed.
