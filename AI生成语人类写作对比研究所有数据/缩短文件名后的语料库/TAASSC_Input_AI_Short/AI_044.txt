This article traces the historical development and disciplinary evolution of English for Specific Purposes (ESP), examining how the field has grown in response to the practical demands of diverse academic, professional, and technical domains. Through a critical review of foundational texts and institutional trajectories, the study highlights the role of relevance as a central organizing principle in ESP's formation—where linguistic analysis is closely tied to learner needs and context-specific communication. The paper discusses key influences such as applied linguistics, genre theory, needs analysis, and corpus linguistics, which have shaped ESP’s theoretical foundations and pedagogical practices. It also addresses tensions between specialization and broader educational goals, as well as the challenges of maintaining academic rigor while delivering practical outcomes. Ultimately, the article positions ESP as an interdisciplinary, socially responsive field that continues to evolve alongside global shifts in language use, professionalization, and higher education.
