This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of integrating an Instant Response System (IRS) with peer instruction (PI) on 102 Taiwanese EFL undergraduates’ learning achievement and perceptions. Over six weeks, the experimental group (n = 52) used IRS (ZUVIO) for formative assessments, while the control group (n = 50) followed a non-IRS PowerPoint-based approach. ANCOVA revealed significantly higher post-test scores in vocabulary, grammar, and reading for the IRS group (F = 26.93, p < .001, η² = .28). MANOVA further showed superior perceptions across nine dimensions, including attention, participation, and confidence (Pillai’s Trace = .64, p < .001). Interviews confirmed IRS fostered adaptive scaffolding, intensive interactivity, and reduced anxiety, though technical and pacing issues were noted. Results support IRS-PI as an effective tool for enhancing engagement and achievement in large EFL classrooms.
