This review examines the emergence of distinct learner profiles in second language acquisition, focusing on how individual differences in cognitive and affective factors shape divergent learning trajectories. Using latent profile analysis on a large dataset of English learners, the study identifies multiple groups characterized by varying levels of motivation, anxiety, and self-regulation. These profiles are then linked to differential development in language proficiency over time. The findings highlight that learner variability is not linear or uniform, but patterned and dynamic, reflecting complex interactions between psychological traits and learning environments. The study underscores the value of person-centered approaches in second language research, offering nuanced insights into how different learner types respond to instruction and progress through language development. Implications are discussed for personalized language teaching and curriculum design, emphasizing the need to account for the diverse profiles of learners in both research and pedagogical contexts.
