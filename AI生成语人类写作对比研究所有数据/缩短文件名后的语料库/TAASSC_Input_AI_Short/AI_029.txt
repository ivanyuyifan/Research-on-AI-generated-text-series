This article explores how a critical translingual pedagogy can foster linguistic solidarity and political consciousness among racially and linguistically diverse students. Focusing on an 11th-grade Chicanx/Latinx Studies class in California, the study examines a week-long unit in which Latinx and African American students collaboratively wrote corridos—traditional Mexican ballads—to narrate their lived experiences with injustice. Drawing on ethnographic and participatory design research, the authors analyze how translanguaging and collaborative writing enabled students to articulate resistance, affirm identities, and build cross-racial alliances. The findings highlight how students used fluid language practices to express care, solidarity, and critical reflections on race, language, and power. The study contributes to applied linguistics by demonstrating how translanguaging, when grounded in social justice, can transform literacy instruction and support youth activism.
