This study investigates the effects of proficiency and textual enhancement techniques on the acquisition of the English third-person singular /~s/ and /~es/ forms among Japanese university students. Textual enhancement (TE) involves altering texts to increase the saliency of target linguistic elements. The study employed two forms of TE—color and underline enhancements (COL) and font size enhancements (SIZE)—and compared them against a comparison group (COM) with unenhanced texts and a true control group (CTRL) with no treatment. A total of 382 participants were divided into higher and lower proficiency levels based on their English scores. The results showed that both COL and SIZE groups demonstrated significant, albeit small, gains in acquisition as measured by grammaticality judgment tests (GJT), while the COM and CTRL groups showed no significant improvement. The study also found that lower proficiency learners benefited more from TE than higher proficiency learners. Post-assessment interviews revealed that most participants did not consciously notice the target form, suggesting that TE alone may not be sufficient to trigger deep processing necessary for acquisition. The findings highlight the importance of considering proficiency levels in TE research and the need for combining TE with strategies that promote deeper learner engagement. Future research should explore the impact of TE on different target forms and proficiency levels, as well as the role of depth of processing in acquisition.
