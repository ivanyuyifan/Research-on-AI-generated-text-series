This article explores how English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) can be used to promote intercultural responsibility within English-Medium Instruction (EMI) contexts. Drawing on classroom data and teacher reflections from an international university setting, the study investigates how students and instructors engage across linguistic and cultural differences during EMI interactions. The analysis highlights the role of ELF not just as a functional tool for communication, but as a medium for fostering mutual understanding, empathy, and ethical engagement. Key findings reveal that successful EMI practice requires raising awareness of power dynamics, embracing diverse English usages, and promoting dialogic participation. The authors argue for a shift from native-speaker norms toward a more inclusive, responsibility-driven model of ELF communication. The study contributes to the growing body of research on ELF and EMI, emphasizing the need for pedagogical frameworks that integrate intercultural competence, critical language awareness, and global citizenship education.
