This qualitative study explores how 27 Chinese EFL university writing teachers perceive learning from giving feedback on student writing. Drawing on reflective practice theory, semi-structured interviews and document analysis reveal that while nine teachers viewed feedback as burdensome and unproductive, 18 reported significant learning outcomes. Five key themes emerged: improved feedback literacy and practice, deeper understanding of student needs, enhanced instructional strategies, development of personal language and academic writing skills, and integration of feedback into teacher research. The findings challenge the prevailing narrative of teacher feedback as a “foe,” suggesting that reflective engagement with feedback can foster teacher professional growth and bridge the gap between research and practice.
