This study investigates the diachronic development of authorial presence in research article abstracts published in high-impact journals over the past four decades. Drawing on a corpus of 400 abstracts from the fields of applied linguistics and biology (1980sâ€“2010s), the analysis focuses on the use of first-person pronouns, authorial self-reference, and stance markers. Results reveal a marked increase in explicit authorial presence over time, particularly in applied linguistics, reflecting a shift toward greater self-promotion and discursive visibility. Biology abstracts, while also showing growth, remain more restrained and impersonal in style. The study attributes these changes to broader academic trends, including increasing emphasis on authorial identity, reader engagement, and disciplinary norms of communication. By combining quantitative frequency data with qualitative discourse analysis, the paper offers a nuanced view of evolving academic writing conventions. The findings contribute to our understanding of disciplinary variation and diachronic change in academic discourse, with implications for EAP pedagogy and scholarly communication practices.
