This study investigates the use of phrasal verbs in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), challenging the perception that such expressions are too informal or imprecise for academic discourse. Using corpus-based analysis, the article examines the frequency, distribution, and functions of phrasal verbs in a range of academic texts, including both student writing and published research. Findings reveal that while phrasal verbs are less common in formal academic writing than in general English, many are nevertheless used productively and meaningfully, especially in applied fields. The study highlights how avoidance of phrasal verbs may hinder natural expression and lexical variation for EAP learners. It argues for a more balanced pedagogical approach that includes awareness of register-appropriate phrasal verb use rather than blanket exclusion. By reevaluating the role of phrasal verbs in academic contexts, the article contributes to a more nuanced understanding of academic vocabulary and supports more flexible, genre-sensitive EAP instruction.
