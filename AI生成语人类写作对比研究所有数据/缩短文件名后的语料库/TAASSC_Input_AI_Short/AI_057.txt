This article examines how Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) teachers conceptualize and implement language instruction within their subject teaching. Drawing on interview and classroom observation data, the study investigates the alignment—or lack thereof—between teachers’ theoretical understandings of language and their practical classroom strategies. Findings reveal that while many CLIL educators acknowledge the importance of language development, language often remains secondary to content objectives in practice. The study identifies varying degrees of pedagogical integration, shaped by teachers’ disciplinary backgrounds, training, and institutional contexts. Some teachers adopt a more implicit approach to language support, while others implement explicit scaffolding techniques. The paper argues that a clearer articulation of language objectives and enhanced teacher training in linguistic awareness are essential for achieving the dual goals of CLIL. This research contributes to the broader discourse on language-content integration and offers practical insights for improving CLIL implementation through more balanced and intentional pedagogical frameworks.
