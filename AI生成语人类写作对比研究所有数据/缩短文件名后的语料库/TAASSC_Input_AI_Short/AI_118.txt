This study examines how verb argument construction (VAC)-based indices of syntactic sophistication predict second language (L2) writing quality across task types and prompts. Drawing on usage-based theory, we analyzed 210 essays from descriptive, independent, and integrated writing tasks using VAC frequency and association strength measures derived from COCA. Multinomial logistic regression showed that descriptive essays relied on more frequent VACs and lemmas, whereas integrated essays used less frequent constructions, indicating task-specific complexity profiles. Linear models revealed that writing quality was differentially predicted by VAC indices depending on task: collostruction ratio predicted descriptive quality, lemma-construction frequency predicted independent quality (negatively), and construction frequency predicted integrated quality (negatively). Prompt effects were minimal, except in independent tasks, where the “cooperation” prompt elicited higher-quality essays with more frequent lemma-VAC types. These findings suggest that VAC-based indices are sensitive to task demands and provide a nuanced, usage-based lens for assessing L2 writing proficiency.
