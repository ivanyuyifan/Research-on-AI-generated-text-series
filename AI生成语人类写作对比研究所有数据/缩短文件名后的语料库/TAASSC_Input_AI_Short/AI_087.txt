This study explores the frequency, function, and distribution of idioms in English academic speech and writing, challenging assumptions that idiomatic expressions are largely absent from formal academic discourse. Using corpus-based analysis across spoken and written academic registers, the research identifies commonly used idioms, their contextual functions, and their variation by genre and mode. Findings show that idioms—particularly semi-fixed and metaphorical expressions—do appear in academic contexts, though more frequently in speech (e.g., lectures, discussions) than in written genres (e.g., research articles). Idioms are often employed to emphasize points, signal stance, or enhance interpersonal engagement. The study argues that idiomatic language plays a subtle yet strategic role in academic communication, especially in spoken interaction. Implications are discussed for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) pedagogy, including raising learner awareness of idiomatic usage and encouraging pragmatic competence in academic settings. This research contributes to our understanding of formulaic language in academia and calls for a more nuanced view of academic register conventions.
