This meta-regression examined the relationship between English writing self-efficacy and achievement across 76 studies (565 effect sizes). Results revealed a medium overall effect (r = .29), with a significantly stronger association among L2 writers (r = .44) compared to L1 writers (r = .23). Effect sizes were attenuated when affective or achievement covariates were controlled. No moderating effects were found for gender, grade level, or publication type. Findings emphasize the heightened importance of self-efficacy in L2 contexts and support targeted interventions to foster L2 writersâ€™ confidence and performance.
