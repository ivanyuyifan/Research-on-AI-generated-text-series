This longitudinal case study investigates how six L2 English graduate students in a U.S. Master of Laws (LLM) program developed metacognitive genre awareness while learning to write the office memorandum—a key legal genre. Over 15 weeks, data from interviews, stimulated recalls, and student texts were analyzed using metacognition theory (Flavell, 1979). Results show that all participants expanded their genre awareness across declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge domains, with conditional awareness—particularly regarding audience impact—emerging most robustly. However, development was uneven: students with prior experience in related legal genres (e.g., case analysis) demonstrated more strategic regulation (planning, monitoring, evaluating) than those without. Aashna, new to legal writing, showed limited procedural and regulatory awareness, while Paul, a former research assistant, leveraged transferable genre knowledge to demonstrate advanced metacognitive control. Findings underscore the idiosyncratic nature of genre learning and highlight the need for context-sensitive scaffolding.
