This article explores a model of public applied linguistics through collaborative activism with Afrikaaps Hip Hop language technicians in post-apartheid South Africa. Drawing on a panel discussion at a public book festival, the author examines how Afrikaaps—a localized variety of Afrikaans—serves as a resource for addressing social issues such as self-worth, commonality, gangsterism, and healing. The study situates this work within a broader tradition of multilingual activism and critiques of linguistic injustice. Through metalinguistic commentary and performance, Afrikaaps speakers challenge the erasure of creole histories and advocate for linguistic empowerment. The article frames this collaboration as an egalitarian partnership between scholars and community-based activists, advancing a model of public applied linguistics rooted in linguistic justice, social transformation, and decolonial praxis. It concludes by calling for methodologies that center historically marginalized voices and support sustainable, community-led linguistic interventions.
