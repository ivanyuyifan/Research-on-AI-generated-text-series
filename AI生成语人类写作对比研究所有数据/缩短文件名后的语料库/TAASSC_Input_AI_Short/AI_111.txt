This study examines how working memory capacity (WMC) and second language (L2) proficiency jointly influence L2 writing performance among 59 Spanish/Catalan learners of English. Using a narrative video-retell task, we assessed writing quality via holistic ratings and multidimensional CAF measures (accuracy, lexical/syntactic/propositional complexity, fluency). Moderation analyses revealed that WMC positively predicted accuracy only at lower L2 proficiency levels, aligning with compensation theory. Conversely, WMC enhanced lexical sophistication exclusively among higher-proficiency writers, supporting the rich-get-richer hypothesis. No significant relationships emerged between WMC and syntactic complexity, propositional density, fluency, or holistic scores. Findings underscore the domain-specific and proficiency-contingent role of WMC in L2 writing, highlighting the need for nuanced cognitive-pedagogical frameworks and discrete assessment practices.
