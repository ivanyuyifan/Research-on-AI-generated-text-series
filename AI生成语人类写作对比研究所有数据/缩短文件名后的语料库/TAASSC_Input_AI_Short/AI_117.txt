This study replicates and extends Lowie and Verspoor (2019) by investigating whether intraindividual variability in L2 writing proficiency predicts proficiency gains better than traditional individual difference (ID) factors. A longitudinal design tracked 22 Chinese university learners of English over nine months, collecting 12 writing samples and measuring language aptitude (LLAMA), working memory (operation span), and motivation (L2 Motivational Self System). Unlike prior work with Dutch adolescents, these learners had limited extramural exposure and typological distance between L1 and L2. Results confirmed the original findings: traditional ID factors failed to predict final proficiency or gains, whereas variability—operationalized as the coefficient of variation—significantly predicted both. Regression analyses further revealed that variability was the sole significant predictor of gains and, alongside starting proficiency, of final proficiency. Qualitative trajectory analysis indicated that higher variability reflects dynamic exploration and adaptive strategy use. These findings underscore variability as a robust, context-independent predictor of L2 writing development, aligning with complex dynamic systems theory.
