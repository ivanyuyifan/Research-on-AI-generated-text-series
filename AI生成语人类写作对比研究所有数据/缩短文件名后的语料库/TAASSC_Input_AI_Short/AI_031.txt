This study presents a corpus-based list of commonly used English medical morphemes aimed at supporting students of English for Medical Purposes (EMP). Drawing on a 1.3-million-word medical corpus composed of textbooks, research articles, and clinical guidelines, the authors identified frequently occurring medical morphemes and analyzed their productivity and coverage. A total of 208 morphemes—comprising prefixes, suffixes, and roots—were selected based on frequency thresholds and expert validation. The list was evaluated for its ability to enhance students’ comprehension and retention of specialized vocabulary. Findings indicate that mastery of these morphemes significantly improves the decoding of complex medical terms and fosters autonomous vocabulary learning. The study advocates for the integration of morphological instruction in EMP curricula and provides pedagogical implications for materials development and classroom practice. This morpheme list serves as a practical tool for learners and instructors, offering a linguistically principled and empirically grounded resource to address the lexical demands of medical English.
