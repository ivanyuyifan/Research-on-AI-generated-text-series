This article reviews a longitudinal study investigating the development of written syntactic complexity among Turkish EFL learners in an intensive English program. Drawing on 852 writing samples from 284 students across three proficiency levels, the study employs the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) to assess 14 indices across five syntactic dimensions. Results reveal that syntactic complexity generally increases over time, particularly in measures related to sentence length, subordination, and phrasal sophistication. However, growth patterns vary by index, with coordination showing mixed or even declining trends. The study highlights the slow and nonlinear nature of syntactic development, especially in the early stages, and attributes variation to instructional intensity, linguistic typology, and potential crosslinguistic influence. These findings underscore the importance of longitudinal, multidimensional assessment in second language acquisition research and provide pedagogical insights into the pacing and targeting of writing instruction in EFL contexts.
