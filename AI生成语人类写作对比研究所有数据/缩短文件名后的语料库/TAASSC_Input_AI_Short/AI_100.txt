This review examines recent developments in English language teaching (ELT) with a focus on the integration of attitude and emotion in digital multimodal composition (DMC). By analyzing empirical and theoretical literature, the study highlights how DMC fosters learner engagement, emotional expression, and identity construction through the use of diverse semiotic resources such as visuals, sound, and text. The review situates DMC within the framework of systemic functional linguistics and multimodal discourse analysis, emphasizing the role of appraisal theory in understanding how learners convey attitudes and interpersonal meaning. Findings indicate that DMC not only enhances linguistic and digital literacies but also provides a platform for learners to develop emotional awareness and communicative competence in a digital age. Challenges related to pedagogical implementation, assessment, and teacher preparedness are also discussed. The review advocates for a more holistic and emotionally responsive approach to ELT that integrates multimodal creativity and affective learning.
