This study explores how plagiarism is conceptualized and addressed in the context of Thai higher education, focusing on local perceptions among students, educators, and administrators. Drawing on interviews, surveys, and policy analysis, the article reveals a complex interplay of cultural, institutional, and pedagogical factors that shape attitudes toward academic integrity. Rather than a singular view of plagiarism as academic misconduct, participants described it variably as a survival strategy, a consequence of systemic inefficiencies, or a result of insufficient academic training. The findings highlight tensions between global norms of originality and local educational practices, raising questions about the effectiveness and fairness of plagiarism policies imported from Western contexts. The authors argue for more context-sensitive approaches to academic integrity that consider linguistic challenges, instructional practices, and the need for ethical academic socialization. This research contributes to the global discourse on plagiarism by emphasizing the importance of culturally responsive policies and pedagogies in international and multilingual education settings.
