This article presents a systematic review of research on computer-mediated collaborative writing (CMCW) in second language (L2) classrooms, synthesizing studies published between 2000 and 2020. The review analyzes 38 empirical studies across diverse educational settings, focusing on key themes such as task design, technological tools, learner interaction, language development, and affective factors. Findings indicate that CMCW enhances linguistic accuracy, fluency, and complexity while fostering peer negotiation and learner autonomy. Synchronous and asynchronous platforms each offer distinct affordances, with tools like wikis, Google Docs, and discussion forums enabling collaborative revision and meaning-making. However, challenges such as unequal participation, technological constraints, and instructor preparedness persist. The review highlights the importance of scaffolding, clear role allocation, and effective feedback mechanisms to maximize pedagogical benefits. It concludes by recommending future research directions, including longitudinal studies, cross-context comparisons, and investigations into multimodal collaborative writing. This study contributes to the fields of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and second language acquisition (SLA) by providing a comprehensive overview of CMCWâ€™s potential and pedagogical implications.
