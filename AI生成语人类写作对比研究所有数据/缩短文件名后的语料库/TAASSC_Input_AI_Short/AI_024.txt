This article explores the pivotal role of translation in facilitating intercultural communication in an increasingly globalized world. It challenges traditional notions of translation as a neutral, technical process by emphasizing its function as a culturally and ideologically embedded act. Drawing on theoretical insights and empirical examples, the author argues that translation actively shapes cross-cultural understanding, mediates power relations, and influences perceptions of cultural difference. The paper examines overt and covert translation strategies, highlighting their implications for intercultural awareness and communicative ethics. It further discusses how translators serve as intercultural agents, whose decisions reflect broader sociopolitical contexts and affect the reception of meaning across linguistic boundaries. The study advocates for greater recognition of translation's mediating role in applied linguistics and calls for pedagogical frameworks that prepare translators to navigate cultural complexities responsibly and reflexively.
