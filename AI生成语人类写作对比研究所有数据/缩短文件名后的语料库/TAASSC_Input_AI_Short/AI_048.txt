This article investigates the socio-contextual nature of written feedback in higher education, emphasizing how feedback functions not only as pedagogical input but also as a socially situated communicative act. Employing a corpus-informed approach, the study analyzes a large dataset of authentic written feedback comments from university instructors across disciplines. The analysis focuses on the linguistic features, pragmatic functions, and interpersonal dimensions of feedback, revealing variations shaped by institutional norms, disciplinary conventions, and power dynamics between instructors and students. Key findings highlight the dual role of feedback as both evaluative and supportive discourse, with implications for how students interpret and respond to it. The study argues for a more context-sensitive understanding of feedback practices that considers the relational and affective aspects of academic communication. These insights contribute to enhancing feedback literacy and promoting more effective and inclusive feedback strategies in higher education settings.
