This study explores how Japanese university learners autonomously protect and enhance their willingness to communicate (WTC) through idiodynamic peer–peer strategy sharing. Nine B1-level students used bespoke software to record moment-to-moment fluctuations in confidence, anxiety, or motivation during an English discussion, then interviewed partners to elicit coping strategies. Clustered analyses revealed two learner archetypes: proactive “talk-positive” students and passive “talk-averse” peers. Proactive students orchestrated a three-step protocol—visualizing talk-positive goals, metacognitive resetting, and targeted action—which neither group had been explicitly taught. Peer exchanges additionally fostered rapprochement and reassurance, addressing unmet socio-affective needs. Strategies spanned metacognitive (goal-setting), affective (kinesic resetting), and social domains (paraphrasing, empathy), and continued to influence students’ subsequent learning. The findings advocate replacing teacher-fronted WTC interventions with learner-driven, context-sensitive strategy co-construction.
