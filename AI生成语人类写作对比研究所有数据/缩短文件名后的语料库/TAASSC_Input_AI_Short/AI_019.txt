This article investigates the influence of role models in language learning, with a focus on how learners’ identification with successful multilingual individuals can impact motivation, identity construction, and language investment. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and classroom interactions, the study explores how learners engage with role models—such as peers, teachers, celebrities, or fictional characters—who embody attainable linguistic and cultural goals. The findings reveal that role models serve as catalysts for aspiration, resilience, and reimagining learner trajectories, particularly among marginalized or minoritized groups. The paper emphasizes the dynamic interplay between social context, learner agency, and imagined communities, arguing for pedagogical approaches that critically incorporate diverse, relatable role models into language education. This contributes to a broader understanding of affective and identity-related dimensions in second language acquisition and multilingual development.
