This study investigates the impact of different multimedia representations—verbal-based Menu Driven Interface (MDI), visual-based Graphical User Interface (GUI), and visuospatial-based Zoomable User Interface (ZUI)—on second language (L2) vocabulary acquisition. Fifty monolingual British undergraduate students learned Arabic vocabulary using the Computer-Assisted Vocabulary Acquisition (CAVA) software. Results from immediate and delayed post-tests showed that while ZUI was most effective in the short term, GUI demonstrated better long-term retention. No significant differences were found across the three interfaces, suggesting that combining verbal, visual, and spatial elements (as in ZUI) enhances immediate learning, while visual representations (GUI) support better long-term recall. The study highlights the potential of integrating visuospatial design elements in multimedia CALL environments to improve L2 vocabulary learning. Future research should explore the long-term effects of such designs and their impact on different cognitive abilities.
