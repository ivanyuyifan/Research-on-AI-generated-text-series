This mixed-methods study investigates whether combining computer-mediated communication (CMC) with data-driven instruction enhances Chinese EFL learners’ pragmatic competence in compliment responses (CRs). Fifty-nine intermediate-level university students were assigned to either an experimental group (CMC + data-driven instruction) or a control group (CMC only). Data were collected via Skype text chats and retrospective interviews across pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-intervention stages. Quantitative results revealed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in appropriateness and variety of CR strategies at both immediate (p = .025, d = 0.53) and delayed post-tests (p = .022, d = 0.53), indicating durable effects. Qualitative findings identified three key factors influencing CR production: limited L2 pragmatic knowledge, crosslinguistic influence from Chinese, and online processing difficulties. The study corroborates Schmidt’s noticing hypothesis, demonstrating that explicit meta-pragmatic instruction within CMC fosters noticing, understanding, and long-term retention. Implications suggest integrating CMC and data-driven pedagogy to enhance L2 pragmatics instruction in EFL contexts.
