This study investigates learnersâ€™ perceptions and interactive dynamics during collaborative writing tasks in a Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) classroom. Employing a qualitative research design, the study draws on classroom observations, written texts, and post-task interviews to analyze how learners engage with each other and the target language in joint writing activities. Findings reveal that collaborative writing enhances linguistic awareness, promotes peer scaffolding, and fosters learner autonomy. However, challenges such as unequal participation, limited language proficiency, and task ambiguity also emerged. Learners expressed generally positive attitudes toward collaborative writing, recognizing its role in improving vocabulary, grammar, and overall confidence in language use. The study underscores the pedagogical value of collaborative writing in CFL contexts, emphasizing the importance of task design, group dynamics, and teacher facilitation in maximizing learning outcomes. These insights contribute to the broader field of second language writing and provide practical implications for integrating collaborative approaches in foreign language instruction.
