This longitudinal study investigates the interplay between English proficiency, language gain, and academic language-related challenges among Turkish EMI undergraduates in International Relations (social sciences) and Electronic Engineering (MPLS). Using a pre-/post-test design over four years (N = 198), we assessed students’ general English proficiency and perceived challenges across four skills via the validated EMI Challenges Scale. Results show that initial proficiency significantly predicts challenges in both disciplines, with a stronger effect in International Relations (R² = .368 vs. .11). While both groups improved linguistically, language gain only predicted reduced challenges in International Relations (β = −.331, p < .01), not in Engineering. MANOVA further revealed a clear B2 proficiency threshold in International Relations, beyond which linguistic challenges drop sharply—an effect absent in Engineering. These findings underscore discipline-specific dynamics in EMI and suggest that social science students may benefit from targeted B2-level support, whereas MPLS students require broader pedagogical accommodations.
