This study examines the complex intercultural and sensory experiences of hearing mothers raising deaf children, focusing on how they navigate the tensions between global hearing norms and their children’s visual-sensorial deaf worlds. Drawing on critical discourse analysis of interviews, the research highlights the embodied, linguistic, and ideological negotiations mothers undertake in response to cochlear implant (CI) technologies and mainstream educational discourses. Rather than viewing deafness as a fixed deficit, the study reveals how mothers participate in “in-between” cultural spaces through sign-supported English, American Sign Language, and home languages. These spaces allow for shared meaning-making despite societal pressures toward monolingualism and hearing conformity. Mode-switching and blending in maternal narratives underscore the affective and relational dimensions of intercultural communication, challenging static notions of Deaf culture and identity. Ultimately, the research foregrounds the intimate, yet often overlooked, translational work of mothers who bridge sensorial and linguistic worlds amid dominant ideologies of hearingness and technological normalization.
