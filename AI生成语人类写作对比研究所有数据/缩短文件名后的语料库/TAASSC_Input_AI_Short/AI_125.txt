This study employs Critical Discourse Analysis to examine nine plagiarism policies across colleges at the University of Iowa. Findings reveal that disciplinary policies are dominated by moral and regulatory discourses, framing plagiarism primarily as transgressive misconduct. While policies share some common elements, significant gaps and inconsistencies emerge in defining key concepts like paraphrase, intent, and citation norms. These disparities place the burden of interpretation on undergraduate students navigating multiple, discipline-specific policies. The study argues for policy revision—integrating developmental discourses, explicit cross-disciplinary guidance, and educative scaffolding—to reduce confusion and support students’ academic writing development.
