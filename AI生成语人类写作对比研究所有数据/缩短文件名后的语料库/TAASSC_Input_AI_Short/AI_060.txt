This study examines how interpersonal relations are constructed in peer review reports based on differing editorial recommendations—acceptance, revision, or rejection. Using a corpus of 90 reviewer comments from applied linguistics journals, the analysis applies a discourse-pragmatic framework to investigate variation in interpersonal features such as stance, politeness strategies, mitigation, and alignment. The findings reveal that reviews recommending rejection tend to employ more direct and critical language, while those suggesting revision or acceptance incorporate greater interpersonal sensitivity through hedging, praise, and constructive feedback. These differences reflect reviewers’ negotiation of dual roles as evaluators and collaborators within academic communities. The study highlights how linguistic choices in peer reviews are shaped by not only evaluative stance but also relational and rhetorical considerations. It contributes to a deeper understanding of scholarly communication practices and offers implications for reviewer training and academic writing pedagogy, especially for early-career researchers and multilingual scholars navigating the peer review process.
