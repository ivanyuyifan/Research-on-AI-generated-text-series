This study investigates the impact of explicit instruction on the development of complex noun phrase (NP) structures in the academic writing of second language (L2) undergraduate students. Using a pretest–posttest design, the research involved participants enrolled in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course who received focused instruction on NP components such as premodifiers, postmodifiers, and nominalization. The analysis of writing samples revealed significant improvements in the syntactic complexity and variety of noun phrases after instruction, with students demonstrating greater use of adjectival modifiers, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses. The findings suggest that explicit instruction can effectively enhance L2 learners’ control over key grammatical resources crucial for academic writing proficiency. The study contributes to applied linguistics by highlighting the value of targeted grammar teaching in supporting syntactic development and writing quality in EAP contexts.
