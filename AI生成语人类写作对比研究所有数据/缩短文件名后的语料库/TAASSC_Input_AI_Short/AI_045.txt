This article presents the development of a component analysis framework designed to support the construction of a research-based curriculum for teaching written English for Academic Purposes (EAP). The study outlines a systematic approach for identifying and categorizing linguistic and rhetorical components across academic texts, with a focus on genre-specific conventions in higher education writing. Drawing on corpus-based methodologies and pedagogical theory, the authors developed analytical tools to break down complex academic writing into teachable elements. These tools informed the design of curriculum materials that target the needs of EAP learners, particularly in higher education contexts. The paper discusses how the component analysis supports the alignment of instructional content with empirical evidence and learning objectives, enhancing both curriculum relevance and student outcomes. The findings demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s potential for informing EAP course development and advancing evidence-based teaching practices in academic writing instruction.
