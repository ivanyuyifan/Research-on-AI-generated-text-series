This article investigates how writers in English and Spanish research articles (RAs) “sell” their findings in discussion sections, focusing on the rhetorical and intercultural strategies employed to assert significance and gain reader acceptance. Using a genre-based and contrastive rhetoric approach, the study analyzes a corpus of RA discussions from applied linguistics journals published in both languages. The analysis reveals cross-linguistic similarities in overall rhetorical moves—such as summarizing results, interpreting findings, and highlighting implications—but also notable differences in stance, persuasion, and writer-reader interaction. English RA writers tend to adopt a more assertive and promotional tone, while Spanish writers favor a more cautious and dialogic style. These variations reflect underlying cultural preferences for academic communication and disciplinary norms. The study contributes to intercultural genre analysis and offers practical insights for multilingual scholars navigating academic publication in diverse linguistic contexts.
