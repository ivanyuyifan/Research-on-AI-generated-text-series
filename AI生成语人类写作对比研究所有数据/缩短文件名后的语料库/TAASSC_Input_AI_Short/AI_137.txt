This study employs cluster analysis to delineate motivational profiles among 359 Greek university students of English for Academic Purposes, integrating ideal/ought-to L2 selves with promotion/prevention instrumentality. Three distinct clusters emerged: highly motivated “sustainers” (Cluster 1) who combine strong ideal L2 selves and promotion orientations, maintain C-level competence, and aspire to postgraduate study abroad; low-motivated “certificate achievers” (Cluster 2) characterized by weak ideal selves and prevention foci, who exhibit competence decline; and “overstrivers” (Cluster 3) who display high scores across all motivational components yet experience attrition, reflecting competing promotion and prevention pressures. Objective TOEFL-ITP scores and self-reported certificates tracked motivational durability, while parental education and urban residence correlated with sustained competence and future goals. Results corroborate that promotion orientations foster long-term L2 proficiency, whereas prevention orientations erode it, underscoring the interplay of identity, socio-cultural capital, and regulatory focus in Greek higher education.
