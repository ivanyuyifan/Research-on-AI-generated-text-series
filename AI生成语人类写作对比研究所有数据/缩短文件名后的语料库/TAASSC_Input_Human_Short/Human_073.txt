Source use is an important yet challenging feature of academic writing. Students may
receive academic literacy support in their universities, but little research has focused on
the support available on source use. This study addressed this gap by investigating two
Chinese students’ engagement with a range of support on source use in one UK university
over one-year taught Master’s programmes, namely, the link between input, student
perception and their source use performance in writing. Text analysis, discourse-based
interviews and semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant at four
stages over the year. It was found that different focuses of source use were addressed in
different ways through add-on support courses, yearlong in-sessional EAP courses, subject
lecturer’s guidance and feedback. The two students varied in their ability to recall the input
and the actions they took, resulting in differences in their source use practices in writing.
Implications on providing international students with support on source use will be discussed.
