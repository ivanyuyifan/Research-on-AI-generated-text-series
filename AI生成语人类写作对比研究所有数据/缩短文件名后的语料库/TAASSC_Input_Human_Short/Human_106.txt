This study investigated the types of multimodal writing tasks that undergraduate students in academic contexts (i.e., degree-pursuing undergraduate students at a US university) are required to complete. With an assumption that undergraduate courses across disciplines are one target language use domain for international students in ESL courses in tertiary education, we interviewed seven professors in Humanities, Education, Business, and Engineering and analyzed 104 multimodal writing tasks we identified from 161 syllabi across the disciplines. We report parameters that can be used to develop multimodal writing tasks in EAP classes and for research on multimodal composing processes: 1) goals and instruction of multimodal writing: disciplinary versus creative expression; 2) linguistic mode in multimodal texts: written and spoken words; and 3) tasks of multimodal writing: individual versus collaborative work. Based on the results, we discuss pedagogical implications regarding the design of multimodal writing tasks for L2 academic writers.
