This article finds empirical evidence of second language (L2) interactional competence (IC) and its development by focusing on one of the interactional practices: self-repairing. Compared to prior repair IC studies which mainly have explored how L2 speakers deal with evident L2-related troubles in conversation, this study focuses on cases in which they deploy self-repair when there are no such linguistic problems in previous talk, taking Mauranen’s (2006) dichotomy between retroactive and proactive self-repairs. After analyzing the conversation by L2 speakers with different oral proficiency, this study discovers whereas novice and intermediate speakers self-repair for correcting what is lexically or grammatically problematic, advanced speakers deploy self-repair mostly for pre-empting possible misunderstandings. Advanced speakers replace the previous items into words that are specific in the meaning range by fine-tuning the level of ‘granularity’ (Schegloff 2000) to avoid ambiguity and further other-initiated repair. The findings suggest that the development of L2 IC involves speakers’ ability to detect potential problems in the eyes of the recipients and replace them in advance.
