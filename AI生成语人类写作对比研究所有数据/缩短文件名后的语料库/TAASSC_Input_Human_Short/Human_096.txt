Integrated writing and strategy instruction (SI) in the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) context have increasingly drawn much research interest in recent years for their strong pedagogical and assessment value. The role of video in integrated writing has also been widely acknowledged for pedagogical and theoretical reasons. However, research on the use of video in integrated writing tasks especially in the EAP context still remains scarce. To address this gap, this paper examines the effect of SI on students’ integrated writing as indicated in their overall writing performance scores and in each of the scoring rubric scales and the differences in their performance per Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) level. We conduct explicit SI intervention for one semester in an EAP course. The success of the intervention is highlighted in the experimental group students’ substantial improvement in their overall writing scores and particularly in the citation and verbatim scales especially at intermediate and advanced level. Our findings suggest the positive impact explicit SI has on integrated writing performance. They also highlight the value and feasibility of using video in instruction and assessment of integrated writing in EAP contexts.
