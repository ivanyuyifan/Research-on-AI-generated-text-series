Medical students with English as an additional language often face difficulties in acquiring English medical terminology derived from Greek and Latin morphemes. To address this problem, this study used a corpus-based approach to identify the most commonly occurring medical morphemes in four sources: Stedman's list of medical morphemes; the Cengage list of general English morphemes; the Center for Development in Learning list of general English morphemes; and the Medical Web Corpusâ€”a web-based corpus of current medical texts available through Sketch Engine text analysis software. Three medical dictionaries were used to validate the findings, leading to a final list of 136 specialized medical morphemes which cover 8.5% of the lexical items in the Medical Web Corpus. The findings provide a reliable and useful resource to help medical students with English as an additional language enhance their English medical vocabulary.
