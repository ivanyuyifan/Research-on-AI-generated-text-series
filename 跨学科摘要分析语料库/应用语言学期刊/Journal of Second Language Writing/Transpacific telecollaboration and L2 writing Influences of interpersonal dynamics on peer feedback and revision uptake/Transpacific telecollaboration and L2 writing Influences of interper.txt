Few existing studies have reported on how group dynamics relate to online peer feedback interactions and subsequent revisions in second/foreign language writing, with no such investigation in telecollaborative contexts in which partners alternate between roles of reader/writer, native/non-native speaker, and expert/learner. This study explored the ways that dyadic functioning was associated with the functions of reader/writer comments and feedback focus produced during synchronous interactions among dyads of a Korean-U.S. telecollaborative project and subsequent uptake of feedback in revisions. Grounded in qualitative and discourse analytic methods, findings indicated that depending on dyadic functioning levels, telecollaborative partners performed different reader and writer roles and addressed different aspects of L2 writing. How partners responded to and incorporated peer feedback into their revisions varied systematically by level of dyadic functioning. The findings highlight the jointly-constructed nature of the online interaction and revision uptake and suggest that interpersonal dynamics may be of greater significance than previously suggested. The findings may also help explain the variety of learner experiences documented in previous peer interaction research and may provide insights into how writing and feedback activities can be designed for better outcomes in this context.
