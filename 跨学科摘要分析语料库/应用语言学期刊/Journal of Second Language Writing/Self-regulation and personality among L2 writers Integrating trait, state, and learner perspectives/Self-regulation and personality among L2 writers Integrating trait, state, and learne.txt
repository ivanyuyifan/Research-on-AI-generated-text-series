This study integrated trait, state, and learner perspectives to better understand the potential relationships between self-regulation in L2 writing and two personality factors (conscientiousness and neuroticism) in a university EFL context. Based on an innovative mixed methods design, data from cross-sectional and longitudinal samples were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques, including structural equation modeling, visualization tools, and participant interviews. One novel finding of this study was that, from a trait perspective, conscientiousness positively contributed to self-regulation, whereas neuroticism negatively contributed to it. This analysis also supported a link between self-regulation and L2 writing. From a state perspective, in contrast, fluctuations were observed in self-regulation and personality factors over a 15-week period. Also reported are learner perspectives on self-regulation, which can offer practical insights for writing instructors and advisors. Themes included, among others: social engagement, composing processes, motivational issues, negative emotions, and rationalizing withdrawal. As a whole, this study has implications for understanding L2 writersâ€™ complex attributes in terms of structural relations, temporal dynamics, and writing processes.
