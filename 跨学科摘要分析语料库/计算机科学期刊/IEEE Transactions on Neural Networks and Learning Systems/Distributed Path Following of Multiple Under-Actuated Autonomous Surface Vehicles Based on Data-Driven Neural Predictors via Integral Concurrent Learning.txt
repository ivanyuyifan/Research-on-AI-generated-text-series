This article addresses the problem of distributed path following of multiple under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with completely unknown kinetic models. An integrated distributed guidance and learning control architecture is proposed for achieving a time-varying formation. Specifically, a robust distributed guidance law at the kinematic level is developed based on a consensus approach, a path-following mechanism, and an extended state observer. At the kinetic level, a model-free kinetic control law based on data-driven neural predictors via integral concurrent learning is designed such that the kinetic model can be learned by using recorded data. The advantage of the proposed method is two-folds. First, the proposed formation controllers are able to achieve various time-varying formations without using the velocities of neighboring vehicles. Second, the proposed control law is model-free without any parameter information on kinetic models. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed robust distributed guidance and model-free control laws for multiple under-actuated ASVs with fully unknown kinetic models.
