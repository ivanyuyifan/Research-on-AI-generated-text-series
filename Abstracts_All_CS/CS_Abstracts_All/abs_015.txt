The manuscript presents a performance optimization methodology for UWB signaling under IEEE 802.15.4a channel conditions using pulse shaping. IEEE 802.1.5.4a is widely adapted for wireless personal area network (WPAN), body area network (BAN) as networking standard. The modified pulse shaping is specifically analyzed for the outdoor and industrial IEEE 802.15.4a channel conditions. The pulse shaping is also validated for the effect of interference levels offered to the co-existing Wireless MAN-SCa and Wireless MAN-OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) signaling. The performance has been evaluated for the Gaussian pulse shaping in a multi-user environment. The results for the pulse optimization have been validated for the line of sight and non-line of sight environment to investigate the capability of the UWB pulse for data transmission in multi user scenarios.
