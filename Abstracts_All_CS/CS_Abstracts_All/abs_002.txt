Internet of Things (IoT) networks has been widely deployed as the distributed computing and communication component in the smart city. The security problems in the distributed IoT-assisted computing architecture are still noteworthy and has not been solved satisfactorily. So in this paper, to design and build an access control and admission detection model for the distributed IoT environment, we propose an IND-CCA-secure multi-authority ciphertext-policy ABE (MA-CP-ABE) scheme with outsourced decryption (OD) and progressive mode attribute-based authentication (ABAuthen). In our authenticaiton algorithm, by using the zero knowledge proof, the userâ€™s secret will be protected from leaking out to the server. And due to the randomness of the authentication message, our authentication algorithm can resist the impersonation attacks by the malicious server. Finally, by the theoretical analysis and performance evaluation for our scheme with other state-of-art schemes, we can observe that our encryption and authentication schemes are both efficient and applicable for the distributed IoT-assisted cloud computing.
