This review synthesizes research on self-efficacy among EFL learners by examining latent profiles and their associations with academic emotions, metacognitive strategies, and English achievement. Using latent profile analysis (LPA), the study identifies distinct self-efficacy subgroups among secondary-level EFL learners and explores how these profiles correlate with variables such as enjoyment, anxiety, metacognitive regulation, and standardized test scores. Findings consistently show that learners with high self-efficacy exhibit more positive emotions, employ more effective metacognitive strategies, and achieve higher academic outcomes than those with low self-efficacy. The review highlights the heterogeneity of learner experiences and emphasizes the value of person-centered approaches in understanding motivational constructs. It also discusses pedagogical implications for fostering self-efficacy through targeted interventions and classroom practices. This study contributes to the broader literature on learner psychology in L2 contexts and encourages future research that integrates cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of language learning.
