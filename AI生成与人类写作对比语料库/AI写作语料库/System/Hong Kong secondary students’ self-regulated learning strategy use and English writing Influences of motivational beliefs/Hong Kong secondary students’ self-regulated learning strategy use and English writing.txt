This study investigates how four motivational beliefs—growth mindset, self-efficacy, utility, and interest—shape self-regulated learning (SRL) writing strategy use and competence among 540 Hong Kong secondary ESL/EFL students. Using questionnaires and a narrative writing test, results reveal that high achievers exhibit stronger growth mindset, utility, and SRL strategy use than low achievers. Structural equation modelling shows growth mindset as the strongest predictor of all SRL strategies, while interest significantly predicts self-initiating and revising. Cultural factors rooted in Confucian heritage cultures moderate the relative influence of these beliefs. The findings underscore the need for differentiated instruction that fosters growth mindset and intrinsic interest to enhance ESL/EFL writing performance.
