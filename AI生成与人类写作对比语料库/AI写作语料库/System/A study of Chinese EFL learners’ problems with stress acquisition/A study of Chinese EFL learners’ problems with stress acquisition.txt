This study investigates Chinese EFL learners’ difficulties in acquiring English lexical and sentence stress. Acoustic analysis of 25 learners’ productions revealed systematic misplacement of stress in polysyllabic, derivational, and compound words, alongside failure to reduce unstressed vowels. Learners exhibited weaker distinctions in duration, pitch, and intensity between stressed and unstressed syllables compared to native speakers. These deficiencies stem from L1 tonal interference and lack of vowel reduction awareness. Pedagogical implications emphasize explicit instruction in stress patterns, vowel weakening, and rhythmic contrast to overcome “stress-deafness” and enhance intelligibility.
