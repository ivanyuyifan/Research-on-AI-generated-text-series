This study investigates the optimal timing for conducting a vocabulary quiz in second language (L2) learningâ€”before or after a review session. It replicates and extends Kanayama and Kasahara's (2018) research, examining the long-term retention effects of quiz timing over a one-month period. Sixty-eight first-year university students in Japan participated, divided into two groups: one taking a quiz before the review (S-TS) and the other after the review (S-ST). The results showed that the S-TS group exhibited significantly better long-term retention in both one-week and one-month delayed posttests. The study also explored test expectancy, finding that the S-TS group had higher expectations of subsequent tests, which may have contributed to their enhanced performance. The findings suggest that conducting a quiz before a review session can be more effective for long-term vocabulary retention, potentially due to increased retrieval effort and test expectancy. This study supports the use of retrieval practice as a pedagogical tool and highlights the importance of considering the timing of quizzes in L2 vocabulary instruction. Future research should consider larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs to further validate these findings.
