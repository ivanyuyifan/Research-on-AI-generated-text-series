This study investigates L2 learners’ incidental lexical mining—defined as the spontaneous use of lexical items from input during output—across immediate and repeated oral tasks, and the mediating roles of input repetition, prior vocabulary knowledge, and working memory. Ninety-one Vietnamese undergraduates (A2–B1) performed a picture-prompted narrative task immediately and again two days later. They were assigned to: (1) input exposure before the first task, (2) input plus post-output re-exposure, or (3) no input. Oral samples were analyzed for shared lemmas and formulaic sequences (FS) with the input. Results showed that input groups mined significantly more single words and FS than the no-input group, but input repetition after the initial output did not enhance mining in the repeat task; it only attenuated FS attrition. Task repetition itself did not increase lemma mining but reduced FS mining. Receptive vocabulary predicted lemma mining in the repeat task, whereas productive vocabulary showed a weaker effect in the immediate task. Working memory exerted no influence. Findings suggest that lexical mining occurs without explicit instruction, yet is constrained by item type and prior knowledge rather than memory capacity or input repetition.
