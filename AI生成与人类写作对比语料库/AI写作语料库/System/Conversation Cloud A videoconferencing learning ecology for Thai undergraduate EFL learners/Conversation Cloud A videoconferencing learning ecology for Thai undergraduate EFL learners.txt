This ecological study investigates how a cloud-based videoconferencing environment, Conversation Cloud, enhances Thai undergraduates’ English speaking skills. Drawing on survey (n=115), interview, and field-note data, the study identifies key interacting elements—context, learners, people (moderators, guests, peers), and technology—that collectively shape learning experiences. Rather than isolating factors, the analysis reveals how affordances such as multimodal scaffolding, authentic interaction, and diversity of interlocutors foster an “organic” learning ecology. Students perceived gains in confidence and fluency when sessions were relaxed, technologically stable, and socially engaging. The findings underscore the importance of balancing technological capacity with human and contextual dynamics to create sustainable, learner-centered speaking practice spaces.
