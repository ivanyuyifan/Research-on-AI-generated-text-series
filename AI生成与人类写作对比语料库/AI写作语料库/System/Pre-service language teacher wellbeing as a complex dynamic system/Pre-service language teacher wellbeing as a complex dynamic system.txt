This study applies Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST) to examine pre-service language teacher wellbeing amid COVID-19. Through semi-structured interviews with six European participants during the first pandemic wave, we trace how personal, contextual, and systemic factors co-adapt to shape wellbeing trajectories. Findings reveal wellbeing as a non-linear, self-organising system where attractors such as workaholism or social connection guide stability or change. The pandemic acted as a critical perturbation, disrupting prior equilibria and prompting adaptive responses that varied by individual agency and perceived affordances. Participants drew on routines, boundary-setting, and relational resources to re-stabilise their systems. The study underscores the need for teacher education to foster reflective wellbeing practices and systemic support, offering a holistic alternative to fragmented wellbeing models.
