This mixed-methods study investigates the impact of task-related focus-on-forms (FonFs) activities—namely, attention to spoken form and word parts—on EFL vocabulary development among 124 Iranian university students. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) focus on meaning and use only, (2) additional focus on spoken form, or (3) further inclusion of word parts analysis. A 40-item vocabulary test and focus-group interviews were employed to assess learning outcomes and perceptions. Quantitative results revealed significant between-group differences (F(2,121) = 36.81, p < .001, η² = .37), with the spoken-form + word-parts group outperforming both others. Qualitative findings indicated that explicit attention to pronunciation and morphological structure enhanced retention, self-confidence, and depth of processing. The study supports the Involvement Load Hypothesis and Technique Feature Analysis, advocating for multi-dimensional, form-focused vocabulary instruction in EFL contexts.
