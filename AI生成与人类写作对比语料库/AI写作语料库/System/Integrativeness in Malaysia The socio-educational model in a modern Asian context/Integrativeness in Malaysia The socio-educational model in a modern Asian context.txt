This article re-evaluates the construct of integrativeness within Gardner’s socio-educational model in the context of modern, non-English-dominant Malaysia. Drawing on questionnaire data from 278 upper-secondary students, the study examines whether integrativeness—defined as openness to adopting features of the target language community—remains salient among contemporary learners of English as a foreign language. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor structure encompassing integrative orientation, attitudes to the English-speaking community, and interest in foreign languages. Results revealed moderate-to-strong levels of integrativeness (M = 3.83, SD = 0.60), challenging theoretical claims that the construct has become obsolete amid globalization and lingua franca usage. The findings suggest that integrativeness persists independently of direct contact with native speakers and is not contingent on minority-language dynamics. These outcomes contest dominant critiques and support the continued relevance of the socio-educational model in non-traditional contexts. The study calls for renewed empirical attention to integrativeness alongside emerging motivational frameworks.
