This study investigates the impact of spaced versus massed practice on the acquisition of L2 collocations under incidental and deliberate learning conditions. Two experiments were conducted with Arabic-speaking learners of English. Experiment 1 compared incidental learning of collocations through massed (five repetitions in one session) versus spaced (one repetition per session over five weeks) exposure. Results showed that massed exposure led to significantly higher gains (four collocations out of 25) compared to spaced exposure (one collocation out of 25). Experiment 2 examined deliberate learning, with participants studying collocations in concordance lines either massed or spaced. Here, spaced practice resulted in significantly higher retention (nine collocations out of 25) than massed practice (five collocations out of 25). These findings suggest that while massed exposure is more effective for incidental learning of collocations, spaced practice is superior for deliberate learning. The study highlights the importance of considering learning conditions when designing vocabulary instruction and underscores the role of deliberate attention and repeated exposure in enhancing collocational knowledge.
