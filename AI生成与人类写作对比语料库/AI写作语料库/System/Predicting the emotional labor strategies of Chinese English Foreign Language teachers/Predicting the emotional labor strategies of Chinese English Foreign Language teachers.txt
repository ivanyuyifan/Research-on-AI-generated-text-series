Drawing on survey data from 594 Chinese EFL teachers, this study adopts an etic lens to identify predictors of emotional labor (EL) strategies. Surface acting and expression of naturally felt emotions were measured; deep acting was omitted due to low reliability. Teachers strongly preferred expressing authentic emotions over surface acting (d = 1.35), and the two strategies correlated negatively (r = â€“0.31). Stepwise regressions revealed that positive attitudes toward students, higher emotionality, institutional valuing of English, and teacher autonomy predicted 10 % of variance in authentic expression; sociability alone explained 4.5 % of variance in surface acting. Gender modestly predicted surface acting, with males faking emotions more. Proficiency had no effect. The findings underscore the protective role of trait emotional intelligence and supportive contexts against emotionally costly surface acting.
