This quasi-experimental study evaluates the impact of explicit pragmatic instruction on 18 US learners of L2 Spanish during a 4-week study abroad (SA) program in Spain. Grounded in skill acquisition theory, the intervention combined pre-departure metapragmatic training with in-country practice and feedback. Using oral discourse completion tasks, the study measured pragmatic appropriateness, apology strategies, and speech rate. Results showed that the experimental group (n = 9) significantly outperformed the control group (n = 9) in all three measures, demonstrating enhanced use of native-like strategies (e.g., agentless constructions, varied IFIDs) and faster speech production. Findings underscore the value of integrating explicit instruction into short-term SA curricula to accelerate pragmatic development.
