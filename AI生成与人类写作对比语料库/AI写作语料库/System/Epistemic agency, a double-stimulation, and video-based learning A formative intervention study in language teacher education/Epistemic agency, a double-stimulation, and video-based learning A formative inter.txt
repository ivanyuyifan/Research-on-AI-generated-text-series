This formative intervention study investigates how Vygotsky’s double stimulation design enhances epistemic agency among preservice Chinese language teachers in Australia. Using a culturally responsive, video-based approach, the study engaged 20 participants in identifying challenges in teaching Chinese characters. Through a four-phase double stimulation cycle—conflict of motives, auxiliary stimuli, respecification of the object, and artefact creation—participants collaboratively constructed and recontextualised pedagogical knowledge. Qualitative analysis of group discussions, worksheets, and lesson plans revealed three forms of epistemic agency: direct adoption, adaptive recontextualisation, and novel creation. Findings underscore the dialectical interplay between collective negotiation and individual transformation in teacher education.
