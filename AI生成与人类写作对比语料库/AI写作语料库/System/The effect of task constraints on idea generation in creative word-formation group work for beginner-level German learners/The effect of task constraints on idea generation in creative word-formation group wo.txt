This study examines how task constraints impact idea generation and creativity in beginner-level German learners through group work on word-formation tasks. Participants were divided into two conditions: one with a formal constraint (alliteration) and one without. Results showed that while the non-constraint group generated more ideas overall, the constraint group produced more ideas in German and engaged in more elaborate language-related episodes (LREs) centered around word-formation and meaning. The constraint condition also led to higher creativity, with more opaque and novel compound words being generated, fostering deeper engagement and discussion. These findings suggest that formal constraints can enhance creativity and focus on form-meaning relationships in collaborative group work, potentially benefiting language learning. Future research should explore the long-term effects of such constraints on vocabulary retention and investigate the interplay between task design and learner engagement in different language contexts.
