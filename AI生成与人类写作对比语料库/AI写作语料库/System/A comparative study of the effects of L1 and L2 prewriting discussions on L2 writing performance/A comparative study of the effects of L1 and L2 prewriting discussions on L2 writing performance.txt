This study reviews and compares the effects of first language (L1) and second language (L2) prewriting discussions on L2 writing performance. Drawing on sociocultural theory and collaborative dialogue frameworks, it analyzes empirical findings from controlled experiments and classroom-based studies involving intermediate and advanced L2 learners. The review focuses on how prewriting discussions in different languages influence lexical richness, syntactic complexity, coherence, and content development in subsequent English compositions. Findings reveal that L1 discussions often facilitate idea generation and conceptual planning, while L2 discussions promote target language activation and form-focused attention. However, results are mixed regarding which mode yields superior writing outcomes, with task type, learner proficiency, and group dynamics identified as key mediating variables. The review highlights the pedagogical implications of strategically incorporating both L1 and L2 discussions to support different stages of the writing process. It also underscores the need for further research employing longitudinal designs and fine-grained discourse analysis to better understand the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms underpinning prewriting interactions.
