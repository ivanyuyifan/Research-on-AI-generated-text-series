This study investigates the predictive effects of classroom environment (CE) and trait emotional intelligence (TEI) on Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE) and Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) among Chinese secondary and university students. A total of 1718 secondary students and 1295 university students participated in the study. The results show that both CE and TEI significantly predict FLE and FLA independently. CE has a larger effect on FLE, while TEI plays a more significant role in predicting FLA. The joint effects of CE and TEI indicate that FLE is more influenced by the classroom environment, whereas FLA is more closely related to individual TEI. The findings highlight the importance of both person and environment factors in shaping L2 emotions and suggest that a positive classroom environment and high TEI can enhance FLE and reduce FLA. The study underscores the need for a person-environment interaction approach in understanding L2 emotional experiences and provides implications for creating supportive learning environments and developing emotional intelligence in language education. Future research should explore the reciprocal relationships between these variables and their effects on other L2 emotions and outcomes.
