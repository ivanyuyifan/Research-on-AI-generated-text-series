This study investigates how first-year Chinese undergraduates self-regulate their listening in English-medium instruction (EMI) at a transnational university. Drawing on a mixed-methods design (n = 412 questionnaires; n = 35 interviews), we examined students’ reported listening strategies and their alignment with Zimmerman’s cyclical self-regulated learning (SRL) model. Quantitative results indicate frequent use of metacognitive strategies (e.g., directed attention, problem solving) and deep processing strategies (e.g., elaboration), alongside reliance on mental translation. Qualitative findings reveal a three-phase SRL cycle: forethought (previewing materials, vocabulary), performance (attention management, inferencing), and self-reflection (review, attribution, adaptation). Regression analyses show that self-efficacy significantly predicts strategy use across all dimensions except mental translation, whereas baseline English listening proficiency primarily predicts reduced reliance on translation. The study underscores the pivotal role of self-efficacy and structured preview in facilitating strategic listening, while highlighting the need for targeted support to mitigate less effective strategies among lower-proficiency learners. Implications emphasize integrating language support into EMI curricula during transition periods.
