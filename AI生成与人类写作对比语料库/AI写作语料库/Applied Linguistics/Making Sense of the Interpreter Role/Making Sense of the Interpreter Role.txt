This article reviews research on the evolving role of student interpreters in university healthcare service-learning programs, focusing on their negotiation of ethical standards and professional identities. Based on a longitudinal case study of six advanced Spanish students serving as interpreters in community safety-net clinics, the study explores how students interpret and apply the Code of Ethics for Medical Interpreters. Findings reveal tensions between ethical principles—such as professionalism, impartiality, and advocacy—and students’ empathetic responses and perceived responsibilities toward patients. Students often extended their roles beyond information transmission, acting as cultural brokers or patient advocates, while navigating complex power dynamics with healthcare providers. The study highlights how institutional framing of service-learning and students' linguistic and sociocultural backgrounds shape their positioning and agency. It calls for more comprehensive interpreter training, critical reflection on ethics, and inclusion of community voices in program design. This review contributes to applied linguistics and service-learning scholarship by underscoring the need for socially responsive, ethically grounded interpreter education in multilingual healthcare settings.
