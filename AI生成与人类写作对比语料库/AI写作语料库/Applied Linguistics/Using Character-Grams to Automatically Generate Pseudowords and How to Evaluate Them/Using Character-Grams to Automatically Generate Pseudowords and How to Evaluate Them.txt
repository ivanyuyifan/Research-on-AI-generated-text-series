This paper presents a computational approach to generating pseudowords using character-gram models and proposes metrics for evaluating their suitability in psycholinguistic research. Pseudowords—nonexistent words that resemble real ones—are widely used in language processing studies, yet their manual creation is time-consuming and subjective. The authors introduce an automated method that constructs pseudowords based on character-level n-gram frequencies extracted from natural language corpora. The study explores various parameters, such as word length, n-gram size, and corpus source, to optimize the generation process. It also proposes evaluation criteria based on lexical similarity, pronounceability, and psycholinguistic plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that the method efficiently produces pseudowords that align with human intuitions and experimental needs. This work contributes to the development of reproducible and scalable tools for experimental linguistics and cognitive science.
