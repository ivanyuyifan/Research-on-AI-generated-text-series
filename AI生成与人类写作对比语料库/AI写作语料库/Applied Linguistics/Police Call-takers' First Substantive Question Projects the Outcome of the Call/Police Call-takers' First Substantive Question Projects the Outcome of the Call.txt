This paper investigates the interactional practices of police call-takers, focusing on how they efficiently gather critical information to assess emergency situations. Using conversation analysis of authentic emergency calls, the study explores how call-takers manage the competing demands of urgency, institutional protocol, and caller cooperation. Findings reveal that call-takers skillfully deploy question sequences, topic management, and verbal cues to prioritize relevant information while navigating caller distress or uncooperativeness. The study highlights the dynamic interplay between institutional goals and interactional contingencies, demonstrating how call-takers adapt standard procedures in real-time to maintain control and ensure clarity. These practices are essential for timely and effective police response and illustrate broader issues in institutional communication, decision-making, and risk management.
