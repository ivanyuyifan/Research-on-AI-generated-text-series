This article examines how intersecting ideologies of race, language, and academic success shape student experiences in a dual language school in the U.S. Southwest. Drawing on ethnographic and discourse analytic methods, the study focuses on the positioning of Latinx students who are English-dominant within a Spanish-English bilingual program. Despite the school’s mission to promote bilingualism and equity, students who do not speak Spanish fluently often face racialized assumptions that question their cultural authenticity and academic legitimacy. The phrase “should know Spanish first” exemplifies the essentialist ideologies linking Latinx identity to Spanish proficiency. The study reveals how such beliefs contribute to exclusionary practices, even within ostensibly inclusive educational models. By highlighting the tensions between language ideologies and student identity, the article calls for more nuanced, anti-essentialist approaches to bilingual education that recognize the linguistic diversity within Latinx communities.
