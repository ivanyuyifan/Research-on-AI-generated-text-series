This article examines the dynamics of cultural translation in multilingual corporate workplaces, focusing on how employees navigate linguistic and cultural diversity in everyday communication. Drawing on ethnographic data from a multinational company in Singapore, the study reveals how organizational discourses of diversity often mask hierarchical practices that manage, constrain, or commodify cultural difference. Rather than fostering genuine intercultural dialogue, these environments frequently demand assimilation to dominant linguistic norms under the guise of inclusivity. The paper analyzes how employees strategically translanguage and negotiate their identities within a globalized yet asymmetrical power structure. By highlighting the tension between corporate diversity rhetoric and lived experience, the study challenges celebratory notions of multiculturalism and underscores the need for more critical, ethical approaches to communication in global workplaces.
