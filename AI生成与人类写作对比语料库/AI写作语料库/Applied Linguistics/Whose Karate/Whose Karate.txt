This article explores how karate, as a traditional Japanese martial art, is recontextualized in a multicultural London karate club, focusing on the intersection of language, culture, and identity. Using ethnographic and discourse-analytic methods, the study examines how instructors and students negotiate the authenticity, authority, and ownership of karate through embodied practices, language use, and symbolic performances. The findings reveal that while Japanese terminology and rituals are maintained to project cultural legitimacy, they are also adapted to fit local pedagogical, commercial, and ideological contexts. The concept of "entextualization" is employed to show how elements of karate tradition are decontextualized and re-embedded in new settings, often reflecting broader tensions between cultural preservation and commodification. The study highlights the complex, dynamic processes through which global cultural practices are localized, raising critical questions about tradition, appropriation, and identity in transnational spaces.
