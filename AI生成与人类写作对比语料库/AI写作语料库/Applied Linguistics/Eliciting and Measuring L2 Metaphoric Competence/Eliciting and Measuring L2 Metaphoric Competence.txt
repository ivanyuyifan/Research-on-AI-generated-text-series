This review examines current methods for eliciting and measuring metaphoric competence in second language (L2) learners. Drawing on empirical studies across applied linguistics and cognitive linguistics, the article categorizes existing approaches into production tasks, comprehension tasks, and mixed-method designs. It evaluates commonly used instruments such as metaphor elicitation tasks, metaphor identification procedures (MIP), and metaphor awareness tests, highlighting their strengths and limitations in terms of validity, reliability, and ecological relevance. The review also discusses challenges in defining and operationalizing metaphoric competence, particularly across different L1-L2 contexts and proficiency levels. It identifies a growing interest in dynamic, discourse-based assessments that reflect real-world communicative use of metaphor. The article calls for greater methodological triangulation, the integration of cognitive and sociocultural perspectives, and the development of longitudinal designs. By synthesizing diverse strands of research, this review offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing metaphor-related assessment in L2 learning and informs future pedagogical and research practices.
