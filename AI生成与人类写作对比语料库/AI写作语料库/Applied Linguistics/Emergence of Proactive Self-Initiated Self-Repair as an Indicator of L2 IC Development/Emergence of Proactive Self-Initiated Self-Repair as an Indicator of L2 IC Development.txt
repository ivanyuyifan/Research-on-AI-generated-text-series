This article reviews research on the emergence of proactive self-initiated self-repair as an indicator of second language (L2) interactional competence (IC) development. Drawing on conversation analysis (CA) and longitudinal classroom data, the study investigates how L2 learners progressively use self-repair strategies not only to fix linguistic problems but also to manage interaction, signal awareness, and co-construct meaning. The review synthesizes findings that show an evolution from reactive, problem-solving repairs to proactive, anticipatory forms of self-monitoring, reflecting increased communicative sensitivity and autonomy. It also highlights the role of task design, learner agency, and classroom interactional patterns in shaping the development of repair practices. Methodologically, studies emphasize the importance of micro-analytic approaches to trace moment-by-moment interactional changes. The article argues that proactive self-repair serves as a valuable lens for assessing L2 IC and calls for its inclusion in models of communicative competence. Implications are discussed for teaching practices, assessment, and future research on interactional development in instructed SLA contexts.
