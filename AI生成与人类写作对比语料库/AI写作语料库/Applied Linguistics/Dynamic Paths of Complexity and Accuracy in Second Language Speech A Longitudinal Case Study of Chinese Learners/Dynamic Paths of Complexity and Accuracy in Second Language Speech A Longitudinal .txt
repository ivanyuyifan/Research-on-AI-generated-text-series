This longitudinal case study investigates the developmental trajectories of syntactic complexity and accuracy in second language (L2) speech. Drawing on dynamic systems theory, the study traces the performance of two adult L2 English learners over 13 months through regularly recorded monologic tasks. Quantitative measures reveal non-linear, variable, and individual-specific patterns in both complexity and accuracy, with limited evidence of parallel development. Phase portraits and minâ€“max graphs illustrate periods of acceleration, stagnation, and regression, suggesting that L2 speech development is both dynamic and context-sensitive. The findings challenge traditional stage-based models of L2 acquisition and emphasize the importance of fine-grained, temporally sensitive analyses. By adopting a dynamic perspective, this study provides insights into the variability and co-development (or lack thereof) of key linguistic subsystems in oral production. The article contributes to research on L2 speech development by highlighting the need for longitudinal, learner-specific approaches that account for intra-individual variation over time.
