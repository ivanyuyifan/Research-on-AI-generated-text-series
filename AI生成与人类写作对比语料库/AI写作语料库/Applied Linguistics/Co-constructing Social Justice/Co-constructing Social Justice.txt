This review explores emerging scholarship on language teacher education through the lens of social justice, with a focus on critical pedagogy, multilingualism, and translanguaging. Drawing on empirical and theoretical contributions, the article highlights how teacher educators and pre-service teachers co-construct understandings of equity, identity, and power in linguistically diverse classrooms. It emphasizes the need to disrupt monolingual ideologies and deficit views of multilingual learners by embedding critical reflection and transformative practices in teacher preparation programs. The review also examines the role of translanguaging as both a pedagogical strategy and a stance that validates studentsâ€™ full linguistic repertoires. Case studies and narrative inquiries demonstrate how educators navigate institutional constraints while fostering agentive, justice-oriented teaching. The study calls for sustained engagement with multilingual realities and recommends a shift toward socially responsive and linguistically inclusive models of teacher education. This work contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for systemic change in language education through critical and multilingual approaches.
