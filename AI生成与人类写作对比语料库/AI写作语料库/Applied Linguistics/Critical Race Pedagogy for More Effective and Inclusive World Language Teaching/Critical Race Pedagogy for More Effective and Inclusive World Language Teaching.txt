This review article explores the integration of Critical Race Pedagogy (CRP) into world language teaching to promote more inclusive, equitable, and socially responsive classrooms. Grounded in Critical Race Theory, the article critiques traditional language pedagogies that often marginalize students of color and perpetuate dominant cultural norms. It examines empirical and conceptual studies that apply CRP principles to curriculum design, teacher training, and classroom discourse. Key themes include the validation of studentsâ€™ linguistic and cultural identities, the disruption of Eurocentric language ideologies, and the encouragement of critical consciousness among both educators and learners. The review highlights practical strategies for implementing CRP in language classrooms, such as culturally sustaining materials, anti-racist pedagogy, and community-based learning. It also addresses the challenges teachers face in adopting CRP, including institutional resistance and lack of training. By centering race, identity, and power in language education, this article contributes to the growing call for transformative practices that support equity and justice in multilingual learning environments.
