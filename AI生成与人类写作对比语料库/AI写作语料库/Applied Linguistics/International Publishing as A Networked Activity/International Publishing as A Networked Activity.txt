This article reviews research on international academic publishing as a networked activity shaped by center-periphery dynamics and localized practices. Drawing on studies in applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, and academic literacies, the review examines how multilingual scholars—particularly from peripheral or semi-peripheral contexts—navigate the global publishing landscape. It highlights key tensions between dominant norms enforced by Anglophone, center-based journals and the epistemic, linguistic, and rhetorical resources of local academic communities. The review synthesizes research on gatekeeping practices, language ideologies, and the role of networks, mentorship, and institutional support in shaping publishing trajectories. It also discusses scholars’ agentive strategies, such as voice negotiation, rhetorical adaptation, and translingual practices. The article argues for a more nuanced, situated understanding of academic publishing that accounts for both global inequalities and local affordances. It contributes to critical scholarship on knowledge production by calling for inclusive publishing policies and greater recognition of diverse scholarly voices.
