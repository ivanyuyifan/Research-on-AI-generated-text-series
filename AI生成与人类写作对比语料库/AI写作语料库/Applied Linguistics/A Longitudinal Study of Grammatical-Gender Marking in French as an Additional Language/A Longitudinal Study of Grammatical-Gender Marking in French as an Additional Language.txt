This longitudinal study explores the development of grammatical gender marking in French among advanced English-speaking learners over 21 months, including a 9-month study abroad period. Using both spoken and written tasks, the study examines changes in accuracy, morphological errors, and error types across three phases: pre-sojourn, during, and post-sojourn. Results indicate that while gender accuracy improves significantly over time, particularly in written production, errors persist even at advanced stages. Morphological overspecification and substitution errors decrease, but omission errors remain common. Individual learner trajectories reveal substantial variability, suggesting that development is non-linear and influenced by both internal and external factors. The findings challenge the assumption that advanced learners consistently acquire native-like gender marking and underscore the complexity of late-learned morphosyntactic features. The study highlights the need for sustained exposure and targeted instruction to support long-term development, and it contributes to ongoing discussions about the limits of grammatical acquisition in additional-language learning.
