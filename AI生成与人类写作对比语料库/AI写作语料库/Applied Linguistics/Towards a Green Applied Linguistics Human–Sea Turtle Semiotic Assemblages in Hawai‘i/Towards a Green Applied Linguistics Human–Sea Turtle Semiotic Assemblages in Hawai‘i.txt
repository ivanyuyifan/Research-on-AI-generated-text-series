This article proposes a "green applied linguistics" by examining human–nonhuman semiotic relations through encounters between humans and sea turtles in Hawai‘i. Drawing on ethnographic observations and photographic documentation, the study explores how meaning-making extends beyond human language, involving affective, embodied, and material interactions. The author introduces the concept of semiotic assemblages to highlight how signs circulate across species, challenging anthropocentric frameworks in applied linguistics. By analyzing public signage, tourist behaviors, and the spatial dynamics of beach environments, the paper reveals how ecological, cultural, and linguistic elements intersect to shape human–animal relations. This interdisciplinary approach calls for a reorientation of applied linguistics toward more-than-human concerns, urging scholars to consider environmental ethics, interspecies communication, and the role of language in sustaining multispecies coexistence.
