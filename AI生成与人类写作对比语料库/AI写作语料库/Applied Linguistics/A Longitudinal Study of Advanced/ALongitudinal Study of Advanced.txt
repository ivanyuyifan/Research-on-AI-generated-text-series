This longitudinal study investigates the linguistic development of advanced L2 French and Spanish learners before, during, and after a nine-month study abroad (SA) period. Drawing on the CAFL (complexity, accuracy, fluency, lexis) framework, the study analyzes data from six collection points over 21 months using spoken narrative tasks. Results show that fluency and lexical diversity improved rapidly and significantly during SA and remained stable afterward, while accuracy and syntactic complexity showed slower but steady gains, particularly post-sojourn. Correlation analyses reveal dynamic relationships among CAFL elements, with sustained positive links between fluency and lexis but weaker or inconsistent ties involving accuracy and complexity. The findings support Skill Acquisition Theory by highlighting how SA facilitates the proceduralization and automatization of existing linguistic knowledge, especially in advanced learners. The study challenges the traditional view that SA primarily benefits fluency and vocabulary, suggesting broader linguistic gains when learners possess substantial prior knowledge and engage in extended immersion. These results underscore the need to consider learner proficiency and contextual variation in evaluating SA outcomes and point to the value of supporting learnersâ€™ continued development upon return.
