This study examines syntactic complexity in academic writing produced in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), focusing on texts written by multilingual scholars across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Using a corpus-based approach, the research analyzes a range of syntactic features—including clause types, subordination, coordination, and phrasal elaboration—to assess how ELF writers construct academic prose compared to native English norms. The findings reveal that while ELF writers employ a wide range of complex structures, their use reflects strategic simplification, functional adaptation, and disciplinary convention rather than linguistic deficiency. The study highlights variation in syntactic choices across disciplines and contexts, suggesting that ELF academic writing prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and rhetorical appropriateness. It challenges deficit-oriented perspectives on non-native writing and underscores the legitimacy of diverse syntactic practices in global academic communication. This research contributes to applied linguistics and English for Academic Purposes (EAP), advocating for inclusive models of academic writing that recognize linguistic plurality.
