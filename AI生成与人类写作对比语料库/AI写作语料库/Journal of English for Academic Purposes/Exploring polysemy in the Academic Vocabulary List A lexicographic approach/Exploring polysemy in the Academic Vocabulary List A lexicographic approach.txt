This article examines the polysemous nature of high-frequency academic words from the Academic Vocabulary List (AVL) using a lexicographic approach. Focusing on how multiple meanings of individual words may influence vocabulary acquisition and use in academic contexts, the study analyzes a sample of AVL items across multiple disciplines using dictionary entries and corpus data. The findings reveal that many AVL words exhibit significant semantic variation, including shifts in meaning depending on grammatical function and disciplinary context. This polysemy presents challenges for learners, particularly those unfamiliar with contextual cues that guide accurate interpretation and usage. The study underscores the importance of integrating semantic nuance into vocabulary instruction and materials design in English for Academic Purposes (EAP). It also advocates for lexicographically informed approaches to academic word list development, highlighting the need to move beyond frequency-based selection to account for the complexity of meaning in academic discourse.
