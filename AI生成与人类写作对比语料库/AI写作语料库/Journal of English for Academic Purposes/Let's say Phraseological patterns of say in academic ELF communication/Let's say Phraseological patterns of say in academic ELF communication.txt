This article investigates the phraseological patterns of the verb say in academic English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) interactions. Based on a corpus of spoken ELF academic discourse, the study explores how say functions beyond its literal meaning, identifying its use in recurrent lexical bundles and discourse routines. The analysis reveals that say often appears in formulaic expressions such as let’s say and how do you say, serving pragmatic functions including hedging, exemplification, and managing turn-taking. These patterns reflect speakers’ strategies for negotiating meaning, maintaining interpersonal rapport, and co-constructing knowledge in multilingual academic settings. The findings highlight the fluid and adaptive nature of ELF communication, where phraseological choices are shaped by communicative intent rather than adherence to native-speaker norms. This research contributes to the understanding of ELF pragmatics and phraseology, with pedagogical implications for raising learners’ awareness of authentic spoken academic discourse.
