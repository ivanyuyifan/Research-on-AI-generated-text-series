This article explores the role of local grammars—recurring lexico-grammatical patterns—in realizing discourse acts in academic writing. Focusing on student research articles and expert-written texts, the study applies a corpus-informed analysis to identify how local grammatical structures perform key communicative functions such as defining, exemplifying, hedging, and attributing. The findings show that these patterns are not only frequent but also tightly linked to rhetorical moves within academic discourse, contributing to textual coherence and disciplinary identity. Differences between novice and expert writers highlight the developmental trajectory of mastering such patterns. The study argues for the pedagogical importance of raising learners’ awareness of local grammar-discourse relationships, advocating for genre-sensitive approaches in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of academic literacy and functional grammar in higher education contexts.
