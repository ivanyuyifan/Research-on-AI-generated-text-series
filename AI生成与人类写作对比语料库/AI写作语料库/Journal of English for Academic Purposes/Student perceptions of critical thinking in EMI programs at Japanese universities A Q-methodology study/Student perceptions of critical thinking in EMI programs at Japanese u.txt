This study investigates undergraduate students’ perceptions of critical thinking within English-Medium Instruction (EMI) programs at Japanese universities. Through survey responses and in-depth interviews, the research examines how students understand critical thinking, how they perceive its role in their EMI coursework, and the extent to which they feel equipped to engage in such practices. Findings reveal a general recognition of critical thinking as essential to academic success, yet students report uncertainty about its meaning, inconsistent instruction, and challenges in applying it across disciplines. Language proficiency and cultural norms around classroom interaction also influence students’ willingness and ability to engage critically. The study highlights a gap between institutional emphasis on critical thinking and students’ lived experiences in EMI settings. It calls for clearer pedagogical frameworks and more explicit integration of critical thinking instruction across EMI curricula. These findings contribute to the ongoing dialogue on globalized higher education and the development of critical academic literacies in multilingual contexts.
