This article explores how literature is critically reviewed in the “News and Views” genre, a hybrid academic-journalistic form commonly found in scientific publications. Through a genre analysis of published texts, the study investigates how writers strategically select, evaluate, and synthesize prior research to position their perspectives and guide reader interpretation. The findings highlight the rhetorical function of literature reviews in constructing authority, framing current debates, and foregrounding novelty, often through evaluative language and selective citation practices. Unlike traditional literature reviews in empirical research articles, News and Views pieces tend to adopt a more persuasive and interpretive stance, blending critical commentary with accessible communication. The study contributes to our understanding of genre variation in academic discourse and offers implications for academic literacy development, particularly in teaching students to navigate and produce critical reviews across diverse genres and communicative contexts.
