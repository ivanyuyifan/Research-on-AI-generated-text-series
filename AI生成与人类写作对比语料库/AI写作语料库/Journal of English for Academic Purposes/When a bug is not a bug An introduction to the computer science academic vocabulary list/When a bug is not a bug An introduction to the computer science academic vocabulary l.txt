This article introduces the Computer Science Academic Vocabulary List (CSAVL), a discipline-specific word list designed to support vocabulary development for learners and researchers engaging with academic texts in computer science. Drawing on a large corpus of computer science research articles, the authors identify and analyze high-frequency, pedagogically relevant vocabulary that differs from general academic lists due to domain-specific usage. The study outlines the methodology for compiling the CSAVL, including frequency thresholds, range criteria, and expert validation. Special attention is given to polysemous terms (e.g., “bug”) whose meanings in computer science diverge from everyday or general academic use. The article discusses how such lexical nuances pose challenges for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) learners and highlights the importance of tailored vocabulary instruction. By providing a targeted resource, the CSAVL aims to enhance disciplinary literacy and support more effective reading and writing in computer science education. The study contributes to the growing field of discipline-specific lexical research and has direct implications for curriculum design and instructional material development.
