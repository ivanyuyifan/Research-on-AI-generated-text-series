This exploratory study investigates how the importance of information can be measured in students’ academic notes, with the goal of evaluating note-taking effectiveness. Drawing on a dataset of undergraduate notes from university lectures, the researchers develop and pilot a framework that rates the significance of information captured by students relative to the content and structure of the original lecture materials. The study employs expert ratings and text analysis to identify patterns in how well students retain key ideas, distinguishing between core content, supporting details, and peripheral information. Findings suggest considerable variation in students’ ability to prioritize and record important material, with implications for both academic performance and pedagogical support. The authors argue for the integration of note-taking instruction into academic skills programs and highlight the need for further research into how note quality correlates with comprehension and learning outcomes. This study offers a foundational approach to understanding note value and contributes to broader efforts in academic literacy development.
