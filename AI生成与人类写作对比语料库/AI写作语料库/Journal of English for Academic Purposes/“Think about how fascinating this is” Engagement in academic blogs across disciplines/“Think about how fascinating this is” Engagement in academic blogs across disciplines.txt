This article examines how engagement is constructed in academic blogs across different disciplines, focusing on the linguistic and rhetorical strategies writers use to connect with non-specialist audiences. Drawing on a cross-disciplinary corpus of blog posts, the study analyzes features such as second-person pronouns, questions, evaluative language, and directives to identify patterns of interaction and stance. The findings reveal that while disciplinary conventions influence stylistic choices, academic bloggers consistently employ engagement strategies to foster reader involvement, personalize knowledge, and promote disciplinary relevance. Notably, the use of affective and evaluative expressions—such as “think about how fascinating this is”—highlights a pedagogical intent to make academic content accessible and compelling. The study contributes to research on digital academic genres by showing how blogs serve as a hybrid space for scholarly communication and public outreach. Implications are discussed for genre-based pedagogy and for fostering effective science and research communication in online contexts.
