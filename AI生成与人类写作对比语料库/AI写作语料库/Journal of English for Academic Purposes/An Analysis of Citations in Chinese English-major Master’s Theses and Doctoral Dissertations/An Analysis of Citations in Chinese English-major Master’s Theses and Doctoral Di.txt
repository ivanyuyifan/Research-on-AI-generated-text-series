This article offers a methodological review of empirical studies on authorial evaluation in English academic writing. It classifies the research into four main strands: metadiscourse, stance and engagement, appraisal theory, and corpus-based approaches. Through critical examination of research designs, data sources, and analytical procedures, the review reveals a progression from small-scale qualitative studies to large-scale corpus-driven investigations. Despite advances, challenges persist in operationalizing key constructs, achieving cross-disciplinary comparability, and addressing genre and cultural variation. The review emphasizes the growing trend toward mixed methods and computational tools while underscoring the continued relevance of functional linguistic theories. It identifies the underrepresentation of learner corpora and non-Anglophone contexts as critical gaps. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of how authorial evaluation has been approached methodologically, offering directions for future research aimed at deepening understanding of academic voice, writer identity, and evaluative language practices across diverse academic settings.
