This article investigates the use of transition markers—particularly the adversative connector however—in the Han Chinese-English (CH-EN) parallel corpus of research article translations. Through a corpus-based contrastive analysis, the study examines frequency, distribution, and functional patterns of transitions in Chinese source texts and their English translations. The findings reveal notable differences in the deployment of however and other cohesive devices, highlighting how Chinese originals tend to underuse explicit adversative markers compared to their English counterparts. Translators often compensate by inserting or modifying transitions to meet English discourse conventions, which prioritize clarity and argumentative coherence. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for translation pedagogy, academic writing instruction, and cross-linguistic rhetorical awareness. It contributes to the fields of contrastive rhetoric, corpus linguistics, and English for Academic Purposes (EAP), emphasizing the importance of nuanced discourse marker use in achieving effective academic communication across languages.
