This study explores how doctoral students communicate stance and engage audiences in Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentations, a genre designed to promote concise, accessible research communication for non-specialist listeners. Using a corpus-based discourse analysis, the research investigates linguistic and rhetorical strategies employed to express authorial position, emphasize significance, and build rapport with audiences. The analysis reveals a dynamic interplay of stance markers (e.g., boosters, self-mentions) and engagement strategies (e.g., rhetorical questions, inclusive pronouns, storytelling) that help presenters make complex content relatable and persuasive. The study also identifies genre-specific conventions shaped by the multimodal and time-constrained nature of 3MT presentations. Findings underscore the pedagogical value of the 3MT format for fostering transferable communication skills and disciplinary awareness. The article contributes to academic and professional communication research, highlighting the importance of stance and engagement as central components of effective knowledge dissemination in public academic genres.
