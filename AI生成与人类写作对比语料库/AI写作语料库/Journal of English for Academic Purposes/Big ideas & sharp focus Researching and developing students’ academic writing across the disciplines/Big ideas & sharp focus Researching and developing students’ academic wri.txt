This article reviews research and pedagogical practices aimed at enhancing students’ academic writing in higher education, with a focus on fostering both conceptual depth (“big ideas”) and rhetorical precision (“sharp focus”). Drawing on writing-in-the-disciplines and academic literacies frameworks, the study synthesizes empirical findings from intervention-based research and curriculum-integrated support models. It explores how students develop voice, argumentation, and genre awareness through scaffolded writing tasks, feedback cycles, and reflective activities. Particular attention is given to the challenges students face in articulating disciplinary knowledge and managing audience expectations. The review highlights the importance of embedding writing development within subject teaching rather than treating it as a generic skill. It also identifies effective practices for aligning writing instruction with epistemological and communicative demands of different disciplines. This article contributes to the scholarship on academic literacy by emphasizing integrative, research-informed approaches that support students in producing intellectually ambitious and rhetorically effective academic texts.
