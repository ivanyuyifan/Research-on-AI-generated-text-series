This article investigates how exemplification is employed in research articles (RAs) to support claims, clarify complex ideas, and enhance reader engagement. Using a corpus-based analysis of applied linguistics RAs, the study examines the structural forms, semantic types, and metadiscoursal functions of exemplification across different sections of academic texts. The findings identify a range of linguistic realizations, including noun phrases, clauses, and multi-sentence elaborations, which authors use to provide typical, atypical, or hypothetical examples. Exemplification serves key rhetorical roles such as reinforcing arguments, guiding reader interpretation, and signaling writer stance. The analysis also highlights disciplinary conventions and variation in the density and positioning of examples. By foregrounding the multifunctionality of exemplification, the study contributes to academic discourse analysis and offers pedagogical insights for teaching genre-sensitive writing strategies in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) contexts.
