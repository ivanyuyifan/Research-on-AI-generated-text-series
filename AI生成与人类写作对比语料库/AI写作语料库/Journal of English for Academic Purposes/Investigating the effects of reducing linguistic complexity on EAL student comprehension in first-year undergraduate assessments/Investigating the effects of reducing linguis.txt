This study examines the impact of simplifying linguistic complexity in business case studies to enhance comprehension and engagement among non-native English-speaking (NNS) students. Using a controlled experimental design, the research compares student responses to original versus linguistically simplified versions of case studies in a business English course. Comprehension tests, recall tasks, and learner feedback were analyzed to assess understanding, cognitive load, and perceived usefulness. Results indicate that reducing syntactic and lexical complexity significantly improves students’ comprehension and confidence without compromising the authenticity or pedagogical value of the materials. The findings support the use of adapted texts in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) contexts, particularly in internationalized business education. The study underscores the importance of aligning language complexity with learners’ proficiency levels and suggests that targeted simplification can facilitate deeper content engagement and more effective skill development.
