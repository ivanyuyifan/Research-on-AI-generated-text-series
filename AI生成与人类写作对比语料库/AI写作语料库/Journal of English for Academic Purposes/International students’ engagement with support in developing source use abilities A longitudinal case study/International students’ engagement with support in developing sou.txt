This article investigates how international students engage with institutional support in learning to use sources effectively in academic writing. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and workshops at a UK university, the study explores students’ perceptions of and responses to available instruction on citation, paraphrasing, and avoiding plagiarism. Findings reveal that while students value support services, their engagement is shaped by prior educational experiences, disciplinary expectations, and affective factors such as anxiety and confidence. Many students experience challenges in transferring learned practices to disciplinary contexts, particularly when instruction is generic or decontextualized. The study highlights the importance of ongoing, situated, and collaborative support that connects academic literacies to students’ evolving needs. It calls for more integrated and discipline-sensitive pedagogies to foster ethical and effective source use. This research contributes to understanding academic acculturation and offers practical implications for designing inclusive writing support in higher education.
