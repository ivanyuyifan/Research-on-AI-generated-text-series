This study investigates the effectiveness of using online video-based materials to teach lecture comprehension skills in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) contexts. Drawing on classroom-based research, the paper outlines a pedagogical framework that integrates authentic online lectures with targeted comprehension tasks aimed at developing students’ listening strategies, note-taking abilities, and awareness of lecture discourse structure. The approach emphasizes repeated exposure, strategic scaffolding, and learner reflection. Data collected from student feedback and performance assessments indicate that the video-based intervention improved learners’ confidence and competence in understanding academic lectures. The study highlights the value of multimodal, real-world input in preparing students for university-level listening demands and offers practical recommendations for incorporating digital resources into EAP instruction. This research contributes to the development of listening pedagogy and supports the integration of technology-enhanced learning in academic language education.
