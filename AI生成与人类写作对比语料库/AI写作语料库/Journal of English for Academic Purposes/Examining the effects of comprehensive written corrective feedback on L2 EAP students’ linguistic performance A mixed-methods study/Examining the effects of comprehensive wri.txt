This study explores the impact of comprehensive writing assessment and feedback on the revision practices of L2 university students. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research analyzes students’ initial drafts and revised texts alongside qualitative reflections to examine how feedback influences linguistic and rhetorical improvements. The feedback provided addressed grammar, content, organization, and coherence. Quantitative findings demonstrate that students made substantial revisions, particularly in lexical choice, sentence structure, and idea development. Qualitative data reveal that students perceived the feedback as constructive, though they varied in how effectively they incorporated it. The study highlights the pedagogical value of comprehensive feedback in supporting substantive revisions and fostering metalinguistic awareness. It also underscores the need for feedback strategies that are both formative and responsive to learners’ developmental stages. The findings contribute to L2 writing research by affirming the role of holistic assessment in enhancing academic writing proficiency.
