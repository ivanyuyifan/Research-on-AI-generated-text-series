This article presents a comprehensive review of research on authorial evaluation in English academic writing, focusing on methodological approaches. It categorizes existing studies into four major strands: metadiscourse analysis, stance and engagement, appraisal theory, and corpus-based investigations. By critically examining the methodological frameworks, data sources, and analytical tools used in each strand, the review reveals trends, strengths, and limitations in current research. While qualitative discourse analysis dominates earlier studies, recent years have seen a shift toward corpus-assisted and mixed-method approaches. The review highlights the need for greater methodological transparency, interdisciplinary integration, and contextual sensitivity, particularly in exploring authorial voice across genres, disciplines, and cultural contexts. It also identifies gaps in longitudinal and learner-oriented studies, calling for more diversified research agendas. This synthesis provides researchers and educators with a clearer understanding of how authorial evaluation is conceptualized and measured, offering guidance for future inquiry into academic writing and writer identity.
