This study explores engineering students’ perceptions of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses within the context of internationalized higher education. Based on survey and interview data collected from students at an internationalized university, the research examines how learners evaluate the relevance, effectiveness, and impact of ESP instruction on their academic and professional preparedness. Findings indicate that while students recognize the importance of ESP courses for enhancing discipline-specific communication skills, many express concerns about misalignment between course content and real-world engineering practices. Students also highlight the need for more interactive, practical, and industry-oriented learning experiences. The study reveals differing expectations between institutional language policies and students’ aspirations, pointing to a gap in curriculum design. It advocates for a learner-centered, context-sensitive approach to ESP that integrates authentic tasks and interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings contribute to discussions on the role of English in globalized education and offer implications for improving ESP curricula in STEM fields.
