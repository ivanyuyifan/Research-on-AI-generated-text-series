This article reviews research on incidental academic vocabulary acquisition in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. Focusing on a corpus-based analysis of classroom materials and teacher discourse, the study investigates the extent to which high-frequency academic word families, as defined by the Academic Word List (AWL), are available for incidental learning. Findings show that while EAP courses provide substantial exposure to AWL vocabulary, opportunities for repeated encounters and varied contexts—crucial for word retention—are unevenly distributed. The review also considers pedagogical strategies such as input enhancement, recycling, and learner engagement that may optimize incidental learning conditions. It highlights the role of teacher mediation and interactional scaffolding in reinforcing lexical uptake. The article concludes by advocating for a principled integration of explicit and incidental vocabulary instruction in EAP settings, and calls for more longitudinal studies to trace actual learning gains. This review contributes to vocabulary learning research by linking corpus insights with classroom practices and instructional design.
