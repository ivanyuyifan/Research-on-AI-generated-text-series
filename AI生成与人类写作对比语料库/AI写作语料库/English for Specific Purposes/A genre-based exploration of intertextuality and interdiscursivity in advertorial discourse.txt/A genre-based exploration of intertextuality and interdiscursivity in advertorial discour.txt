This study examines the intertextual and interdiscursive features of English advertorial discourse through a genre-based lens. Drawing on a corpus of 100 advertorials from business and lifestyle magazines, the analysis identifies how advertorials integrate elements from various genres and discourse types, including news reports, testimonials, expert reviews, and advertisements. The study employs genre theory and discourse analysis to explore how intertextual references and discursive shifts function to legitimize promotional content while maintaining a fa√ßade of neutrality and credibility. Findings reveal that advertorials strategically blend informative and persuasive discourse, often embedding voices from authoritative or experiential sources to construct trust and engagement. This hybridization challenges traditional genre boundaries and raises concerns about reader manipulation and genre transparency. The study contributes to our understanding of genre mixing in contemporary media and offers insights into how intertextual and interdiscursive resources are mobilized to serve commercial purposes. Pedagogical implications are also discussed for media literacy and critical discourse education.
