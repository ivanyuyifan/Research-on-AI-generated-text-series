This article investigates lexical variation in empirical research writing across academic disciplines, focusing on how word use reflects disciplinary conventions and rhetorical purposes. Drawing on a corpus of research articles from multiple fields, the study analyzes patterns in the use of high-frequency words and discipline-specific vocabulary. Using a combination of quantitative corpus analysis and functional linguistic frameworks, the authors identify key parameters influencing lexical choices, including field (disciplinary domain), mode (spoken vs. written), and rhetorical function (e.g., reporting, evaluation, or interpretation). The findings highlight systematic differences in lexical preferences between soft and hard sciences, particularly in the use of stance markers, hedging devices, and metadiscourse elements. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of academic discourse by revealing how lexical variation serves communicative needs within epistemologically distinct disciplines. These insights have pedagogical implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction, especially in developing discipline-sensitive materials that address the lexical demands of research writing.
