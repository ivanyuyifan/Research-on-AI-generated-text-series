This article reviews the international academic participation of Brazilian scholars, analyzing structural and systemic factors that contribute to their uneven visibility in global knowledge dissemination. Drawing on sociological and geopolitical perspectives, the study situates Brazil within a semi-peripheral academic position and explores internal disparities across institutions, disciplines, and regions. It highlights how limited access to resources, linguistic barriers, and the dominance of Anglophone publishing norms hinder broader inclusion. The review also addresses the roles of academic evaluation systems, funding policies, and collaborative networks in shaping publication trajectories. Findings suggest that while select elite institutions achieve global reach, many researchers remain marginalized within national and regional contexts—creating a "periphery within the semi-periphery." The article advocates for more inclusive academic policies and supports transnational epistemic justice by acknowledging diverse voices and knowledge systems beyond the global North. It contributes to ongoing debates on center–periphery dynamics, academic dependency, and equitable participation in global research production.
