This article presents the development and evaluation of a pedagogically oriented grammar pattern list for the 150 most frequent academic verbs, based on corpus-driven analysis. Drawing from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus and the Academic Vocabulary List (AVL), the study identifies recurring syntactic patterns used with high-frequency verbs across disciplines. The resulting resource includes verb-specific grammatical constructions, example sentences, and frequency data to support language learning and academic writing instruction. The evaluation phase, which involved EAP instructors and learners, demonstrated the listâ€™s practical relevance for vocabulary development, syntactic awareness, and discipline-sensitive writing competence. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating lexico-grammatical patterning into academic English teaching materials. This study contributes to applied corpus linguistics and supports the creation of more data-informed, usage-based approaches in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) pedagogy.
