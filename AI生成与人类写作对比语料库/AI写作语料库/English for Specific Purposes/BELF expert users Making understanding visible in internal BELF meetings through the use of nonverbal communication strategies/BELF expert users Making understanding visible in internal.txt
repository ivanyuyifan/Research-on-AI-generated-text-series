This article investigates how expert users of Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF) facilitate mutual understanding in internal workplace communication. Drawing on ethnographic data from a multinational company's in-house interactions, the study explores how non-native English-speaking professionals strategically manage clarity, coherence, and alignment without relying on native-speaker norms. Using discourse analytic methods, the authors identify key communicative practices—such as explicit clarification, reformulation, and strategic repetition—that help make understanding visible and actionable. The findings highlight the importance of shared contextual knowledge and pragmatic competence over linguistic accuracy in BELF settings. The study argues that BELF expert users are not merely proficient speakers of English, but skilled communicators who co-construct meaning through adaptive, context-sensitive strategies. This work contributes to the growing literature on international business communication and supports a shift from deficit models to a competence-based view of multilingual workplace interaction.
