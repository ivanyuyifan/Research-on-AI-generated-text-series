This article reviews research on the use and pedagogical implications of lexical bundles in undergraduate academic lectures. Lexical bundles—recurrent sequences of words commonly used in spoken academic discourse—serve essential functions in structuring information, signaling relationships, and managing interaction. Drawing on corpus analysis of lecture transcripts, the study categorizes bundles into discourse-organizing, stance-expressing, and referential functions. Findings indicate that lecturers rely heavily on discourse-organizing bundles to scaffold comprehension and maintain coherence. The review also highlights variation in bundle usage across disciplines and the challenges L2 learners face in acquiring and interpreting these structures. Pedagogically, the study emphasizes the importance of raising learners’ awareness of frequent bundles and integrating them into academic listening and speaking instruction. It calls for data-driven materials and explicit instruction to support learners’ pragmatic competence and lecture comprehension. This article contributes to applied linguistics and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) by linking corpus findings to practical classroom applications.
