This article reviews research on promotional strategies in specialized academic discourse through a multi-level contrastive analysis of book reviews in linguistics and economics. By examining rhetorical, lexico-grammatical, and evaluative features, the study compares how disciplinary conventions shape the ways reviewers promote books, authors, and their own scholarly stance. Findings reveal both cross-disciplinary similarities—such as the strategic use of praise, hedging, and alignment with disciplinary values—and key differences in rhetorical preferences and evaluative language. Linguistics reviews tend to foreground authorial engagement and meta-discursive commentary, whereas economics reviews prioritize objectivity and content-driven appraisal. The study highlights how promotionality operates within disciplinary constraints and contributes to identity construction and knowledge validation. Methodologically, the article demonstrates the value of a multi-level analytical framework that integrates genre analysis with corpus-assisted discourse studies. It calls for more genre-based, cross-disciplinary investigations to understand the interplay between persuasion, evaluation, and disciplinary discourse norms in academic communication.
