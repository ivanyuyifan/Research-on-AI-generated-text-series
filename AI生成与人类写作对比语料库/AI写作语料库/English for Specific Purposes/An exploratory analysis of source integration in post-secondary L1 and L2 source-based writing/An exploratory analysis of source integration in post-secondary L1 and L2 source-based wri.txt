This article reviews research on source integration practices in source-based writing by post-secondary first language (L1) and second language (L2) writers. Drawing on a corpus of academic essays, the study explores how writers in both groups incorporate, attribute, and synthesize source material. Using a discourse-based framework, the analysis identifies key differences in integration strategies, such as the balance between summary and direct quotation, the use of reporting verbs, and the level of source transformation. Findings suggest that L2 writers tend to rely more heavily on direct quotations and display less lexical and syntactic variation when paraphrasing, while L1 writers demonstrate greater rhetorical control and evaluative stance. The article highlights the influence of linguistic proficiency, academic literacy, and instructional context on source use. It calls for pedagogical interventions that scaffold citation practices and rhetorical decision-making in both L1 and L2 academic writing. This review contributes to an improved understanding of how learners at different language proficiencies navigate the complex demands of source integration in academic discourse.
