This article presents the SubESPskills project, which explores the integration of subtitling tasks into Business English teaching as a means of enhancing language and professional communication skills. Grounded in task-based and multimodal learning approaches, the project developed a series of subtitling activities aligned with English for Specific Purposes (ESP) pedagogy. These tasks aim to foster studentsâ€™ lexical competence, listening comprehension, intercultural awareness, and digital literacy, while simulating real-world business scenarios. The study involved piloting the activities with university students and evaluating their impact through qualitative feedback and performance data. Results indicate that subtitling tasks promote learner engagement, contextualized language use, and increased awareness of business discourse practices. The authors argue that subtitling can serve as an effective pedagogical tool for bridging language learning and professional skill development. The project contributes to innovation in ESP instruction and supports the incorporation of media-based, task-driven methodologies in business language education.
