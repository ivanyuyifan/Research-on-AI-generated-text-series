This study investigates the use of pragmatic force modifiers in English-medium master's thesis defenses at universities in Taiwan, focusing on how speakers manage interpersonal dynamics and academic discourse in high-stakes oral examinations. Drawing on a corpus of recorded thesis defenses, the research identifies and analyzes various types of force-modifying expressions—including boosters, hedges, and politeness strategies—used by students and committee members. The findings reveal that pragmatic force modifiers serve crucial rhetorical and interactional functions, such as softening claims, expressing deference, and reinforcing alignment or authority. Usage patterns differ based on participant roles, disciplinary norms, and communicative intent. The study highlights the influence of both local academic culture and global English-medium instruction practices on oral academic performance. By shedding light on the nuanced use of pragmatic language in institutional settings, the research offers insights for EAP pedagogy and oral communication training for graduate students in multilingual academic contexts.
