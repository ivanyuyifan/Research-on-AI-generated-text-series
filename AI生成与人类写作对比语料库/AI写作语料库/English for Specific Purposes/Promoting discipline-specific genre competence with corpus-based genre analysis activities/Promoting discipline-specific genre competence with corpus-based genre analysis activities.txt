This study examines the effectiveness of using corpus-based genre analysis activities to enhance discipline-specific writing competence among university students. Focusing on engineering undergraduates, the research integrates data-driven learning approaches into a genre-based writing curriculum. Through the use of specialized corpora and guided analysis tasks, students explored rhetorical structures, lexical choices, and discourse features characteristic of their academic field. Pre- and post-intervention assessments, along with student feedback, indicate significant improvements in studentsâ€™ awareness and application of genre conventions. The findings demonstrate that corpus-based genre instruction not only fosters rhetorical flexibility and metalinguistic awareness, but also empowers students to critically engage with disciplinary writing norms. The study underscores the pedagogical value of integrating corpus tools into English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction and provides practical insights for developing genre-informed, learner-centered curricula in higher education.
