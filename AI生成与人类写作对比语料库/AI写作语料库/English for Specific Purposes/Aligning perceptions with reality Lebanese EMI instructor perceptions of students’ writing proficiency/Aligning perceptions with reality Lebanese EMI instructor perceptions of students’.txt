This article reviews research on English Medium Instruction (EMI) in higher education, focusing on the alignment between instructors’ perceptions of students’ linguistic preparedness and students’ actual academic performance. Drawing on a study conducted in Lebanese universities, the article compares EMI instructors’ beliefs with students’ demonstrated language skills, particularly in academic writing and speaking. Findings reveal a significant mismatch: instructors often underestimate students’ capabilities or misjudge their specific areas of difficulty. The review discusses how such misalignments may affect instructional practices, student engagement, and learning outcomes. It also highlights the influence of instructors’ language ideologies, prior training, and disciplinary backgrounds on their evaluations. The article calls for increased assessment literacy, reflective teaching practices, and institutional support to foster more accurate and constructive perceptions of student proficiency. This review contributes to EMI scholarship by addressing the critical role of perception-performance alignment in ensuring effective language support and equitable learning environments in multilingual academic contexts.
