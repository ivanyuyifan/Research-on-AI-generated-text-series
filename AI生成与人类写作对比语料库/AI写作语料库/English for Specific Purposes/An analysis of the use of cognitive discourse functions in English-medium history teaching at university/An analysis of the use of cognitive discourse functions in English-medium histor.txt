This article reviews research on the use of Cognitive Discourse Functions (CDFs) in English-medium instruction (EMI) history classrooms, comparing data from two contrasting international school contexts. CDFs—such as defining, explaining, comparing, and evaluating—are central to disciplinary language and content integration. Drawing on classroom transcripts and teacher–student interactions, the study examines the frequency, distribution, and pedagogical deployment of CDFs in relation to curriculum goals and language proficiency. Findings reveal context-specific differences in how CDFs are used, shaped by teacher language awareness, institutional policies, and students’ English competence. While both contexts show attempts to support disciplinary thinking through language, the degree of scaffolding and explicit focus on language forms varies considerably. The article emphasizes the importance of integrating CDFs into EMI pedagogy to enhance content understanding and academic language development. It calls for professional development that equips teachers with strategies to embed CDFs meaningfully into subject teaching, contributing to more equitable and effective bilingual education.
