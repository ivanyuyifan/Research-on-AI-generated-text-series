This study conducts a multi-dimensional analysis of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in corporate annual reports, employing Biber’s multi-dimensional (MD) approach to explore their linguistic characteristics. Based on a corpus of MD&A texts from U.S. publicly listed companies, the research examines six dimensions of variation to determine how these texts balance informational density with promotional and narrative features. Findings show that MD&A discourse is highly informational but also exhibits significant involvement and elaboration, reflecting its dual function: to convey financial transparency and to shape investor perception. Compared to other written genres, MD&A sections uniquely blend objective reporting with persuasive elements. The study highlights the strategic use of stance, modality, and attribution to construct corporate credibility while mitigating risks. These findings underscore the complex communicative role of MD&A texts in financial disclosure and contribute to a deeper understanding of institutional discourse. Implications are discussed for business communication research, financial reporting standards, and ESP (English for Specific Purposes) instruction in financial contexts.
