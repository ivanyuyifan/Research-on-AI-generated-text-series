This article reviews empirical studies examining the relationship between task complexity and linguistic complexity in second language (L2) writing. Drawing on the Cognition Hypothesis and the Trade-off Hypothesis, the review analyzes how task design influences lexical and syntactic complexity, fluency, and accuracy. It categorizes findings based on task variables (e.g., structure, reasoning demands, planning time) and outcome measures (e.g., T-unit length, clause density, lexical diversity). The review reveals inconsistent patterns: while some studies support the claim that cognitively demanding tasks promote linguistic complexity, others show negative or null effects, particularly under time constraints. Methodological variations—such as diverse complexity indices and writing conditions—are identified as major factors contributing to contradictory results. The article calls for more unified measurement approaches and longitudinal designs to better capture developmental trends. It also advocates for integrating qualitative data to understand learners’ cognitive processes during writing. Overall, this review challenges simplified assumptions about task effects and contributes to refining theoretical models of task-based language learning.
