This article explores the under-examined role of play in second language (L2) academic writing. Synthesizing theories of play and language play, it argues that playful manipulation of genre, form, and writing processes can foster metalinguistic awareness, identity expression, and writer agency. Drawing on collaborative anecdotes, empirical studies, and classroom applications, the paper demonstrates how play—ranging from parody and genre bending to multilingual experimentation—can reduce writing anxiety, enhance motivation, and support rhetorical flexibility. It concludes with pedagogical strategies and a research agenda to integrate play into L2 writing instruction.
