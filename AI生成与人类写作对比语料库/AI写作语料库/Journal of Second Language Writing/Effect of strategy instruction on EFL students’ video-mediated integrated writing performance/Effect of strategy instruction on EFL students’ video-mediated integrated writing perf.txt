This study investigates the impact of explicit strategy instruction (SI) on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) studentsâ€™ performance in video-mediated integrated writing tasks. Conducted within a Greek tertiary education context, the quasi-experimental study involved 118 students divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received a seven-session SI intervention focusing on source selection, organization, and citation strategies. Pre- and post-tests, including a reading-and-watching-to-write (RW2W) task, were administered and scored analytically. Findings revealed significant improvements in overall writing performance for the experimental group, particularly in citation and avoidance of verbatim language use. Results were consistent across both intermediate (B-level) and advanced (C-level) CEFR students, demonstrating the efficacy of SI regardless of proficiency level. These findings suggest that even short-term, targeted instruction can enhance integrated writing skills and academic source use in EFL learners. Implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction and assessment design are discussed.
