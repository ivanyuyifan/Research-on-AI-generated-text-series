This study investigates the beliefs and practices of two novice secondary EFL writing teachers in Macau through the lens of complexity theory (CT). Using a multiple-case design, data were collected via semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and documents over one academic semester. Findings reveal distinct belief-practice systems: one teacher exhibited an element-based approach, emphasizing vocabulary accuracy and genre-topic alignment, while the other adopted a process-oriented model, focusing on idea development and two-draft writing cycles. Despite internal coherence within each system, both teachers encountered tensions between their espoused beliefs and enacted practices, largely due to contextual constraints such as high-stakes testing and rigid curricula. Unlike expert teachers who adapt strategically, novices tended to compromise core beliefs under institutional pressure, reflecting fragile belief systems. The study underscores CTâ€™s utility in capturing the dynamic, non-linear interplay among beliefs, practices, and context. Implications highlight the need for novice teacher education to foster critical reflection, contextual adaptation, and resilience against systemic constraints.
