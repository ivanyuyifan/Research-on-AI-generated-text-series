This qualitative study explores the nature and development of L2 writing teacher expertise through the cases of three experienced Hong Kong school teachers. Framed by adaptive expertise, the research examines teachers’ integrated knowledge of writing, student-centred pedagogy, reflective vision, leadership in innovation, and affective commitment. Data from interviews and classroom observations reveal that expertise is not static but dynamically constructed through ongoing learning, contextual problem-solving, and professional agency. Contributing factors include cognitive engagement in classroom inquiry, social collaboration within communities of practice, and passion for writing and teaching. The findings challenge idealized expert–novice dichotomies and offer a multi-dimensional model for L2 writing teacher education.
