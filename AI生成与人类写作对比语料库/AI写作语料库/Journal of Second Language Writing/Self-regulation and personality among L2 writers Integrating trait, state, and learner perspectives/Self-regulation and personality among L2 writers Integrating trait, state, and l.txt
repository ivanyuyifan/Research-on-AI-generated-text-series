This mixed-methods study explores the interplay between self-regulatory capacity (SRC) and personality (conscientiousness and neuroticism) in L2 writing across trait, state, and learner perspectives. Study 1 (N = 645) used SEM to model stable relationships: conscientiousness positively predicted SRC, whereas neuroticism negatively predicted it; SRC marginally but positively related to self-reported writing ability. Study 2 longitudinally tracked three Japanese EFL writers over 15 weeks, employing questionnaires and interviews. Moving correlations revealed dynamic, idiosyncratic relationships: conscientiousness generally supported SRC, while neuroticism often competed with it, though for one writer neuroticism later became facilitative. Interviews showed writers deploying diverse self-regulatory strategies—seeking help, planning, or managing anxiety—tailored to their personality and context. Findings underscore SRC’s dual trait-state nature and highlight the need for pedagogical approaches that nurture self-regulation while accommodating individual differences.
