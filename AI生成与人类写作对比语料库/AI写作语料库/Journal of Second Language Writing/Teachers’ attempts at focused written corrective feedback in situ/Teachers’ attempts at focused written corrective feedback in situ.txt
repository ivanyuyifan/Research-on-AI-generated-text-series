This study investigates two Hong Kong secondary EFL teachers’ year-long attempts to implement focused written corrective feedback (WCF) within authentic classrooms, adopting an ecological approach informed by complexity theory. Departing from experimental paradigms that isolate WCF from instructional context, we examined how teachers negotiated the shift from comprehensive to focused WCF amid institutional pressures and diverse student needs. Through interviews, classroom observations, and student texts collected across four writing tasks, findings reveal that teachers adopted a “focused and student-specific” approach, targeting pre-selected error types while selectively addressing individual errors. This hybrid practice, though messier than idealized models, catalyzed pedagogical innovation: teachers integrated focused WCF with genre-based instruction, reduced task frequency to enable multiple drafting, and expanded feedback to content/organization. Quantitative analysis of pre-/post-study writing tests (n=63) showed significant overall accuracy gains (p<.05), while qualitative data highlighted students’ heightened engagement in self-initiated revisions. The study underscores WCF as a situated, teacher-driven act shaped by contextual affordances and constraints, challenging dichotomous views of comprehensive versus focused WCF. Implications emphasize the need for context-responsive teacher education that reframes WCF as leverage for holistic writing pedagogy rather than mere error correction.
