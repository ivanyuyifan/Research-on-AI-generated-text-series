This study examines the negative side of feedback in Chinese EFL writing through a critical incident lens. Drawing on 35 valid incidents from 1,075 undergraduates across 11 universities, we identify feedback attributes—such as lack of specificity, unclear criteria, inconsistency, and one-way transmission—that trigger unintended harm. These features negatively affect students’ writing practices, emotional states, motivation, and interpersonal relationships. Students respond by selectively using, accepting, ignoring, or seeking external help regarding feedback. The findings underscore the need for dialogic, learner-centered feedback and enhanced feedback literacy to mitigate harm and foster constructive engagement in L2 writing development.
