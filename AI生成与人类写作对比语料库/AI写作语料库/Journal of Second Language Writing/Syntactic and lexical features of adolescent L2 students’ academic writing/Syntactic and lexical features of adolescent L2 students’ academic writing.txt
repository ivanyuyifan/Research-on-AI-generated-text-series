This study examines syntactic and lexical features of 86 text-based analytical essays written by Spanish-speaking adolescent L2 students (7th–12th grade) in California. Manual coding and Coh-Metrix analyses revealed prevalent sentence boundary errors (33%), limited subordination, and low lexical diversity. Complex and compound sentences, age of acquisition, and word imageability significantly predicted writing quality (R² = .41). Findings highlight the gap between students’ linguistic resources and Common Core academic expectations, underscoring the need for targeted instruction in syntactic complexity and academic vocabulary for secondary L2 writers.
