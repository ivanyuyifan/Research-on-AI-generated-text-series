This meta-analysis synthesizes 37 empirical studies to examine the effects of collaborative writing (CW) on second language (L2) learning. Focusing on measures of accuracy, complexity, fluency, and overall language proficiency, the study calculates weighted effect sizes to determine the pedagogical value of CW. Results indicate a moderate overall positive effect, with the strongest gains in grammatical accuracy and syntactic complexity. Moderator analyses reveal that task type, learner proficiency, and instructional context significantly influence CW outcomes. The study also highlights the benefits of CW for fostering metalinguistic awareness, negotiation of meaning, and social interaction, which support deeper language processing. However, variation across studies suggests that contextual and design factors mediate the effectiveness of CW. The findings support the integration of CW into L2 pedagogy while calling for more longitudinal and ecologically valid research. This meta-analysis contributes to evidence-based practice in L2 instruction and offers implications for curriculum design, teacher training, and assessment strategies in collaborative language learning environments.
