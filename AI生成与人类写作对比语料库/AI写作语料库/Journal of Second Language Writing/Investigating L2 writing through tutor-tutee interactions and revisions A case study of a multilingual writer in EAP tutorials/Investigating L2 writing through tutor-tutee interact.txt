This case study examines how tutor–tutee interactions shape multilingual writers’ text revisions and L2 writing development within an EAP context. Guided by Vygotskian sociocultural theory, we analyzed eight weekly tutorials involving a Thai undergraduate writing three distinct assignments. Findings reveal that tutor Ryan adjusted his focus and directiveness based on task type and tutee responsiveness, prioritizing rhetorical concerns while addressing emergent linguistic needs. Ling’s uptake varied: surface-level revisions were consistently incorporated, whereas text-level changes depended on time, task demands, and institutional feedback. Over the semester, her drafts showed improved organization, argumentation, and counterargument use. The study underscores the nonlinear, mediated nature of L2 writing development and recommends tutor training that balances directive support with learner autonomy.
