This cross-case study examines how dyadic functioning shapes peer feedback and revision uptake in transpacific telecollaboration between Korean and U.S. university students. Over eight weeks, four focal pairs (two high- and two low-functioning) exchanged synchronous chat feedback on L2 essays. High-functioning pairs exhibited collaborative discourse: readers provided indirect, elaborated suggestions and invited negotiation, while writers actively sought clarification and jointly planned revisions. Low-functioning pairs displayed asymmetrical interaction: readers issued direct, sentence-level corrections, and writers responded passively or resisted. Consequently, high-functioning writers incorporated 85 % of peer feedback exactly, whereas low-functioning writers rejected 72 %. The findings underscore that interpersonal dynamics, rather than native-speaker status or proficiency, critically determine feedback quality and learning outcomes. Pedagogical implications include fostering collaborative strategies and mutual trust in telecollaborative tasks.
