The benefits of collaborative writing (CW) for second language (L2) learning rest on solid theoretical underpinnings. Unequivocal empirical evidence of those benefits has proven difficult, however. This meta-analysis examines the accumulated evidence by synthesizing the results of 33 studies that explored the learning effects of CW and by gauging the magnitude of the difference between collaborative and individual writing. The characteristics and research practices of these product-oriented CW studies were also synthesized. Across studies, the effects of CW have been assessed through complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) measures as well as rubric scores and grammar/vocabulary tests. The accumulated findings suggest that collaboratively written texts were more accurate than individually written texts, with a mean effect size of a medium magnitude (g=0.73). Further, a large magnitude difference in rubric scores (g=0.94) was found in favor of individual texts written after experimental CW conditions compared to those written after control individual writing conditions. Findings regarding other dependent variables were inconclusive because of insufficient accumulation and excessive variability across individual studies. Methodological and pedagogical implications are discussed.
