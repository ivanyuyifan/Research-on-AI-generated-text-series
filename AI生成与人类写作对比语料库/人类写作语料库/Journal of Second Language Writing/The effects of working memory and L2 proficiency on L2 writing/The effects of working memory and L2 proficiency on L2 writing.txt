This study investigated whether the effects of working memory on second language (L2) writing performance depend upon the level of L2 proficiency. Fifty-six learners of L2 English at different levels of proficiency performed a complex working memory task in their native language (Spanish/Catalan), a standardized L2 proficiency test, and a narrative L2 writing task. L2 writing performance was assessed by means of the quantitative measures of accuracy, complexity, and fluency, and by means of holistic ratings of writing quality. The results showed that at low levels of proficiency, working memory was associated with higher accuracy, while at high levels of proficiency, there was a positive link between working memory and lexical sophistication. Our findings demonstrate a differential and nuanced involvement of working memory on L2 writing performance.
