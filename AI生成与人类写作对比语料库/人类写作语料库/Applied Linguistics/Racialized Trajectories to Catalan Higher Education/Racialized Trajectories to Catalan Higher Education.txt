This paper examines two forms of listening in relation to racism and the minoritylanguage context in Catalonia. The research is based on a collaboration between twoacademics and RC (Racialised Catalans) which started with initial interviews on theireducational experiences and trajectories in Catalonia. From there, a collaboration betweenthe academics and a inter-cultural, anti-racism group (Junts a pseudonym) emerged .First, we analyse the role of the white listening subject in which RC are discriminatedagainst for a perceived lack of Catalan. Second, we describe how the group made otherslisten through their work. Thus, listening results in a form of 'undecideability' which requireswider society for the possibilities of racial equality.
