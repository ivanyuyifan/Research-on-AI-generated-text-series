This article presents a visual navigation and landing control paradigm for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to land on a moving autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). Therein, an adaptive learning navigation rule with a multilayer nested guidance is designed to pinpoint the position of the ASV and to guide and control the UAV to fulfill horizontal tracking and vertical descending in a narrow landing region of the ASV by means of merely relative position feedback. To ensure the feasibility of the proposed control law, asymptotical stability conditions are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory. Landing experimental results are reported for a UAV-ASV system consisting of an M-100 UAV and a self-developed three-meters-long HUSTER-30 ASV on a lake to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed landing control method.
