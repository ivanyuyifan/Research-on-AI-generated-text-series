This article presents a collaborative neurodynamic optimization (CNO) approach to multivehicle task assignments (TAs). The original combinatorial quadratic optimization problem for TA is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem with a quadratic utility function and a penalty function for handling load capacity and cooperation constraints. In the framework of CNO with a population of discrete Hopfield networks (DHNs), a TA algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated QUBO problem. Superior experimental results in four typical multivehicle operation scenarios are reported to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed neurodynamics-based TA approach.
