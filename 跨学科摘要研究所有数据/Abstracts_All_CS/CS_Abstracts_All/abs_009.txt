Device-to-device (D2D) communication in 5G can offload large amounts of data from the core network and offer smaller delays in communication, making advantage of the proximity between the devices. Specific attention should be given to a dedicated authentication process as there are significant challenges with respect to security and privacy. We propose the first anonymous group D2D authentication and key agreement protocol, which can be integrated into the existing 5G-AKA protocol with only a few adaptations. No additional initialization or new implementations of security algorithms are required for the user equipment. After a successful run of the protocol, the devices in the group can derive a secure group key and a secret key shared with each other member of the group. Both from a computational and a communication perspective, the scheme is comparable with state-of-the-art related solutions. Moreover, our proposed scheme satisfies several security features, which are not currently available in the existing schemes in literature.
