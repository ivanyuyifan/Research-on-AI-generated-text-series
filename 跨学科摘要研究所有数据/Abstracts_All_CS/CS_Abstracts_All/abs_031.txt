Modern processors often need to switch among different power states based on usage scenarios, energy availability, and thermal conditions. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a commonly used power management strategy to trade off performance and energy. As transistor scaling is reaching its limit, the viable supply voltage range where DVFS can operate is shrinking, which limits its effectiveness. To extend the performance-energy trade-off capabilities in modern processors, this article proposes dynamic core scaling (DCS) that does not rely on voltage scaling. DCS dynamically adjusts the active superscalar datapath resources so that programs run at a given percentage of their maximum speed while minimizing energy consumption at the same time. Since DCS does not need voltage scaling, it can be combined with DVFS to achieve greater energy savings. To effectively manage performance-energy trade-offs using a combination of DCS and DVFS, this article proposes an oracle controller that demonstrates the optimal control strategy, and two practical controllers that are applicable in real implementations. Evaluations using an 8-way superscalar processor implemented in a 45-nm circuit show that DCS is more effective in performance-energy trade-offs than DVFS at the high performance end for a number of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks. When used together with DVFS, DCS saves an additional 20 percent of a full-size coreâ€™s energy on average. At the minimum operating voltage, DVFS hits its limit, while DCS is still able to achieve an average of 46 percent further energy reduction.
