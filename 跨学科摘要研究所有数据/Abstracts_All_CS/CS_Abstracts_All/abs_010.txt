Modern malware threats demand a robust and scalable detection system. This paper presents a novel proactive monitoring and analysis architecture called malware threat intelligence system (MTIS) to collect and classify real-world samples of modern malware families. Microsoft Windowâ€˜s portable executable (PE) files are systematically labeled using clustering and AVClass engine. These labeled malware samples are visualized into grayscale images, which are further utilized for the extraction of textural features. This paper uses local descriptors (LBP, DSIFT, GLCM) and global descriptors(GIST) to extract local and global textural features from a grayscale image. Malware images are distinguished using a hybrid approach of machine learning methods and a proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) employed with early stopping configurations. Results have demonstrated that the proposed architecture detects modern and real-world malware samples with better classification accuracy without code reversing and domain expertise. Four machine learning algorithms, namely, K-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Support vector machine(SVM), Naive Bayes(NB), and Random forest, are compared systematically, with different image resolutions and data split, enabling efficient model selection. Deep learning of MTIS (DL-MTIS) is compared with former methods and with CNN+GIST, CNN with the whole image as inputs, and k-NN+GIST method, and it is observed to be superior in performance. The results also reveal that the proposed method is resilient to packed and encrypted malware samples.
