Erasure coding is a storage-efficient means to guarantee data reliability in today's commodity storage systems, yet its repair performance is seriously hindered by the substantial repair traffic. Repair in clustered storage systems is even complicated because of the scarcity of the cross-cluster bandwidth. We present ${\sf ClusterSR}$, a cluster-aware scattered repair approach. ${\sf ClusterSR}$ minimizes the cross-cluster repair traffic by carefully choosing the clusters for reading and repairing chunks. It further balances the cross-cluster repair traffic by scheduling the repair of multiple chunks. Large-scale simulation and Alibaba Cloud ECS experiments show that ${\sf ClusterSR}$ can reduce 5.6-52.7 percent of the cross-cluster repair traffic and improve 14.4â€“68.8 percent of the repair throughput.
