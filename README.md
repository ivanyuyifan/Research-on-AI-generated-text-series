## Project Overview  
This project is supported by the **Beijing Forestry University College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**.  
It is an open-source initiative to document our team's research on AI-generated text, including:  
- Corpus collection and curation  
- Analysis of syntactic complexity  
- Development and validation of interdisciplinary research metrics  
- Evaluation of AI-generated abstracts  

> **Note**: Content will be continuously updated as research progresses.

## Research Focus  
### 1. Journals  
| Journal                          | Focus Area                                  |  
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Journal of Applied Linguistics**       | Application of linguistic theories in AI-generated text |  
| **Computational Linguistics Journal**    | Algorithmic analysis of text generation models          |  

### 2. Research Metrics (Tentative)  
#### Interdisciplinary Abstracts  
| Metric      | Description                              |  
|-------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Relevance   | Cross-domain alignment and applicability |  
| Coherence   | Logical flow and structural integrity    |  
| Impact      | Potential influence on interdisciplinary fields |  

#### AI-Generated Abstracts  
| Metric      | Description                              |  
|-------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Accuracy    | Factual correctness of generated content |  
| Fluency     | Natural language flow and readability    |  
| Diversity   | Lexical and syntactic variability        |  

```python
# Example: Text diversity calculation
diversity_score = len(unique_words) / total_words
```

## Future Plans
We are actively working on the following goals:
- Finalize interdisciplinary evaluation framework
- Publish reproducible datasets
- Expand metric validation to multiple languages
