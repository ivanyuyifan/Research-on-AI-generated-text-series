## Project Overview  
This project is supported by the **Beijing Forestry University College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**.  
It is an open-source initiative to document our team's research on AI-generated text, including:  
- Corpus collection and curation (interdisciplinary corpus completed; AI-generated abstracts pending)  
- Analysis of syntactic complexity and other metrics using tools such as TAASSC and Coh-Metrix
- Development and validation of interdisciplinary research metrics  
- Long-term evaluation of AI-generated academic abstracts  

> **Note**: Content will be continuously updated as research progresses.

### 2. Research Metrics

#### Interdisciplinary Abstracts  
| Metric                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Syntactic Complexity Analyzer | Measures sentence-level complexity using indices such as MLS, MLT, and C/S |
| Noun Phrase Complexity       | Assesses the density and structural sophistication of noun phrases         |
| Syntactic Sophistication     | Evaluates the use of advanced syntactic structures and rare constructions   |

#### AI-Generated Abstracts  
| Metric                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Syntactic Complexity Analyzer | Analyzes overall syntactic complexity using Lu's 14 indices                 |
| Syntactic Sophistication     | Assesses fine-grained syntactic usage and rare construction frequency       |
| Noun Phrase Complexity       | Measures internal noun phrase structures such as modifiers and length       |
| Clause Complexity            | Evaluates depth and layering of clauses, subordination, and embedding       |
| Discourse Coherence & Readability | Assesses textual flow, cohesion, and accessibility using Coh-Metrix and other tools |


```python
# Example: Text diversity calculation
diversity_score = len(unique_words) / total_words
```

### Current Status & Next Steps

The core research framework and empirical analyses of this project have been completed. 
Based on a series of finalized studies on AI-generated versus human-written academic abstracts, 
we are currently focusing on extension, validation, and dissemination of the findings.

Ongoing and forthcoming work includes:
- Consolidating and refining the interdisciplinary evaluation framework for academic abstract analysis
- Expanding the dataset of AI-generated abstracts across additional disciplines and languages
- Conducting large-scale comparative experiments between human-written and AI-generated abstracts
- Performing systematic syntactic and discourse analyses using TAASSC and Coh-Metrix
- Evaluating the robustness and generalizability of linguistic metrics across domains
- Preparing and submitting manuscripts to peer-reviewed conferences and journals
