ID factors measured were motivation, language aptitude, and working memory. The findings were as follows: None of the ID factors predicted the final L2 writing proficiency nor the L2 writing proficiency gains, but the CoV did. The implications of these findings are discussed. Writing is a function of cognitive and linguistic resources and the writing processes. However, links between cognitive and linguistic resources and the writing process in second language (L2) writing are not well understood nor are their interactions with written products. This study examines the relationships among cognitive and linguistic resources (e.g., attention, working memory, L2 vocabulary knowledge, general knowledge, and L2 reading skills), writing processes (e.g., mean P-burst lengths [mean characters produced between pauses] and mean pause times), and written products (e.g., words per minute, text length, and text quality) in L2 writing. Participants were 100 L2 English learners in a US university. Path analyses showed that greater L2-literacy-related resources (vocabulary, reading, and general knowledge) were positively related to longer essays and high-rated essays. Findings also showed that greater attentional capacity and L2-literacy-related resources predicted shorter mean pause times, which in turn predicted longer essays and higher scoring essays. Furthermore, working memory had positive effects on L2-literacy-related resources, which in turn predicted longer and higher-rated essays.
