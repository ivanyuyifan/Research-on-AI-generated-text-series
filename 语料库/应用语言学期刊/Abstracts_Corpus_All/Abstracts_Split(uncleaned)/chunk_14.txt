Taking a corpus-driven approach, this study explores the use of keywords and lexical bundles in figure legends in order to understand how the discourse is constructed by the salient recurrent single and multiple lexical items. Results show that in figure legends writers are most concerned with the textual descriptions of blue and red as markers of contrasting scientific items and bars and images as representative of graphic shapes. Additionally, writers also frequently use shown and indicated to introduce the demonstrative relationship between graphic elements and scientific information. Further, noun/prepositional bundles account for the overwhelming proportion, followed by verb-related and then clause-related forms, while research-oriented functions of bundles are more frequently used than text and participant-oriented functions. The results offer useful pedagogical input and help novice and L2 writers come to grips with this part-genre. Lecture comprehension is a complex process that involves the decoding of meanings on various levels (e.g., phonological, lexical, syntactic, pragmatic, cultural), thus creating challenges for L2 learners. Moreover, there may be difficulties caused by unfamiliar prosodic patterns or accents of lecturers, as well as facial expressions and gesturing whose meanings may escape L2 students. To address all of these potential obstacles, lecture comprehension activities should implement materials prepared from authentic classroom lectures to provide L2 learners with realistic input, which may also vary according to instructional context. The aim of this article is to illustrate how video-recorded lectures can be analysed to gain insights into their multifaceted nature and how the findings can be used to inform classroom activities to improve lecture comprehension. The article provides 1) a description of how video clips cut from OpenCourseWare lectures can be prepared for research and practice, 2) an overview of two case studies performed on video clips that highlight the use of multimodal ensembles integrating verbal and non-verbal features (e.g., idioms, humour, stance markers, culture-specific references, prosodic patterns, gesturing), and 3) a detailed lesson plan to exemplify how video clips from OCW lectures can be used to facilitate lecture comprehension.
