To address these issues, we developed a large battery of MC tests to elicit Low/Littlemore’s constructs, administering it to 112 L1 Mandarin speakers of L2 English and 31 L1 English speakers. Data cleaning revealed some operationalization challenges, but resulting overall reliability was high and demonstrated innovative use of ordinal omega as a powerful alternative to Cronbach’s alpha, the most common instrument reliability index in L2 research (Plonsky and Derrick 2016). Exploratory factor analysis suggested four latent L2 MC variables: Productive Illocutionary MC, Metaphor Language Play, Topic/Vehicle Acceptability, and Grammatical MC, broadly supporting Low/Littlemore’s proposals. The current study investigated advanced L2 learners’ linguistic development before, during, and after a nine-month stay abroad, the extent to which contextual changes (home-abroad-home) influenced the nature and magnitude of development, and the ways in which relationships among different linguistic elements changed over time. Participants were 56 university learners majoring in French (n = 29) and Spanish (n = 27), who spent an academic year abroad in the middle of a four-year BA degree programme. Oral data were collected six times over 21 months to trace development and change in complexity, accuracy, fluency, and lexis. Results showed ongoing improvements over time on most measures, including accuracy. Correlations indicated long-term relationships between fluency and vocabulary only and that accuracy–complexity relationships emerged in instructed home contexts only. These findings suggest that the affordances of home and abroad contexts can shape learners’ linguistic development and use differently. The role of pre-departure linguistic ability is discussed as critical to understanding the nature and extent of L2 linguistic development in study abroad.
