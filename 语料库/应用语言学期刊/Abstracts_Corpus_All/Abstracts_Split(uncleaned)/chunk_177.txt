Teachers routinely make a conscious effort to manage their emotions in front of students. The present study focused on emotional labor strategies from 594 Chinese English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers, seeking to discover which ones are preferred, how they are related to each other and how they are linked to teachers’ sociobiographical, institutional, attitudinal, linguistic and psychological characteristics. Statistical analyses revealed that the strategy Expression of naturally felt emotions was preferred to Surface acting and that both dimensions were moderately negatively correlated. Correlation analyses revealed that sociobiographical variables were unrelated to both dependent variables. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the strongest predictors of Expression of naturally felt emotions were attitudes towards students, Emotionality (a factor of Trait Emotional Intelligence) and two institutional variables. Sociability (another factor of Trait Emotional Intelligence) was the only predictor of Surface acting. The findings are linked to previous research and some pedagogical implications are presented. While a wide range of trait-like and situational willingness to communicate (WTC) factors have been investigated, subsequent pedagogical advice often focuses on teacher-led interventions and does not enable learners themselves to overcome immediate WTC related difficulties. This may be because little is known about how students protect and enhance their own WTC levels. This study, therefore, positions students as peer—peer strategy investigators; learners used idiodynamic methodology to interview a selected peer about strategies they used to protect and enhance their WTC during a classroom discussion.
