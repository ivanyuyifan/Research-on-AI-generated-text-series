In this study, we explore how video and text impact language choices in the formative feedback of three instructors in US university ESL writing courses. Feedback on 136 essays was analyzed using the appraisal framework, with a focus on attitude. This analysis provides a nuanced, linguistically grounded understanding and description of how evaluation is conveyed, while highlighting the social or interpersonal aspects of language within the communicative context of responding to student writing. Text feedback was found to be more negative, while video offered more balance and showed greater concern for social relationships in the feedback process. Finer grain analysis suggested that instructors may engage with students differently across feedback modes, prompting future possibilities for instructor training. Informed by a learner-centered and socio-constructive approach to the impact of feedback and drawing upon critical incidents from 1,075 Chinese EFL university students and semi-structured interviews with 29 of them, the present study aims to reveal the negative side of feedback by examining its negative influences on L2 student writers and their responses to such influences. Findings reveal seven feedback attributes that could elicit negative impacts on writers: lack of specification, low quality, superficial feedback, unclear feedback criteria, inconsistent feedback, one-way communication, and unclosed loop. Feedback of these attributes could negatively impact studentsâ€™ writing practices, learning emotions and motivation, and social relationships. This study has also found that in response to such negative influences, students would pay selective attention to feedback, accept/reject all the feedback, or seek external help. Based on the findings, a multi-dimensional model concerning the negative side of feedback is proposed, and how writing teachers could alleviate the negative impact of feedback is discussed.
