The research is based on a collaboration between twoacademics and RC (Racialised Catalans) which started with initial interviews on theireducational experiences and trajectories in Catalonia. From there, a collaboration betweenthe academics and a inter-cultural, anti-racism group (Junts a pseudonym) emerged .First, we analyse the role of the white listening subject in which RC are discriminatedagainst for a perceived lack of Catalan. Second, we describe how the group made otherslisten through their work. Thus, listening results in a form of 'undecideability' which requireswider society for the possibilities of racial equality. In the highly multicultural workplace of today’s multinational corporations (MNCs), translating across different cultures becomes a crucial issue. But what precisely counts as culture in the global workplace of the MNC? What does it exactly mean to be able to translate across cultures under the regimes of evaluation adopted by MNCs? In this article, I consider these questions through a discussion of the corporate discourse of diversity management, in which the cultural diversity of the workforce is understood as a resource for maximizing profit. Based on a critical review of diversity management literature and a study on Korean managers working for non-Korean MNCs in Singapore, I first show how diversity management’s claim of openness and inclusivity actually works to reproduce unequal relations in the workplace. I then argue that attention to the politics of translation, where the ideological nature of evaluations of cultural (in)commensurability is highlighted, is needed for applied linguists’ engagement with language and communication in the multicultural workplace.
