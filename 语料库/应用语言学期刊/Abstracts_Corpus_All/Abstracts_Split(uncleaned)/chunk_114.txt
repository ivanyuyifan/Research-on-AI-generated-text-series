A week later, the S-TS group (n = 30) took the first L1 meaning recall test before the review, whereas the S-ST group (n = 38) took the review before the recall test. Both groups took Posttest 1 a week later and Posttest 2 a month later. The S-TS group showed a higher retention rate in Posttest 1 and the gap became larger in Posttest 2. The present study provided original Results in that (a) it showed the positive effects of a test session before the review on long-term retention; (b) it took into consideration the effect of participantsâ€™ expectations of Posttest 1 on the test results; (c) it revealed that higher expectations of a subsequent test by the S-TS group may have led to better performance in the test. This article reports a quantitative empirical study that explored the relationship between English language proficiency and academic language-related challenges experienced by students when studying through English Medium Instruction (EMI). Questionnaire data using the EMI Challenges Scale and student English language test score data were collected at a public university in Turkey. Two academic subjects were compared: International Relations (a Social Science subject, n = 99) and Electronic Engineering (a Mathematics, Physical and Life Sciences subject, n = 99). Results revealed that in both subjects, English language proficiency statistically significantly predicted academic language-related challenges. Furthermore, a gain in English proficiency significantly predicted the challenges in International Relations but not in Electronic Engineering. Finally, Electronic Engineering students experienced significantly different levels of linguistic-related challenges in each language skill when at a lower proficiency (A2) compared to a higher proficiency (B2).
