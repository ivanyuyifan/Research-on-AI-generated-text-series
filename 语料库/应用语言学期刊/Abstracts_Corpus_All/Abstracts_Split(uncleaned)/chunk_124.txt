Additionally, they had to subtitle two videos from Spanish/Chinese into English, related to the aforementioned area of knowledge. Subsequently, a mixed method was followed since quantitative and qualitative data were gathered and analysed. The results presented here aim to prove the potential of active reverse subtitling as a tool for foreign language learning. Discussion (and/or other closing) (DC) sections of research articles in English-medium journals are difficult to write, especially when English is not a first language. This intercultural rhetoric research explores whether greater effort is made to promote research in English than in Spanish. I drew ten pairs of comparable DC sections from the EXEMPRAES (exemplary empirical research articles in English and Spanish) Corpus. I systematically annotated these sections for their communicative functions, and, for the first time, my annotations were validated by the article authors, themselves. Additionally, I used an online survey to understand the authors' promotional behaviour. This innovative mixed methodology confirmed that the social scientists in the study were more promotional in English than in Spanish. Authors in English highlighted more positive aspects of their studies and applications of their results.
