I then reveal why our EAP team harnessed EP’s central process of ‘puzzling’ to develop personalised research agendas and encourage student engagement, practitioner collaboration and novel learning. Finally, I outline how academic and practitioner research in EAP combined with our professional development experiences shaped the approach taken. I gathered a range of qualitative data, observing learners as they puzzled, analysing written summaries of their puzzles and cross-referencing these with my own reflective journal entries. This integration of research and pedagogy created several synergies: Through puzzling, learners better understood their academic journeys, and some highlighted the transferable potential of puzzling. The teaching team also benefited as we began to view learner-initiated puzzling as a continuous exploration, illumination and assessment of learners’ needs. This paper offers a practitioner’s perspective on continuous needs assessment with insights for EAP lecturers and those in adjacent fields. While previous research on syntactic complexity development in academic writing recommends incorporating instruction on complex noun phrases into L2 writing curricula, little is known about the effects of such teaching. Therefore, this study examined writing by undergraduate students enrolled in L2 writing courses to determine whether explicit teaching of complex noun phrases could lead to more register-appropriate use of these features. Specifically, this research compared diagnostic and final in-class writing produced by 30 students who received explicit noun phrase instruction and also conducted a separate analysis of 30 papers by writers who did not experience such teaching. Since prompts were found to be a mediating factor in previous research, this variable was also considered in the analysis.
