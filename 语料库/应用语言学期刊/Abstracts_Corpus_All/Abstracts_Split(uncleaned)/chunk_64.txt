engineering, business), has been widely contested by both social learning theories and research investigating university–workplace transition of novice employees. In this paper, we present a needs analysis conducted in the workplace that addressed socio-contextual elements with the understanding that the complexity of workplace writing needs for English L2 learners is always changing. In doing so, we provide new evidence for the argument that socio-contextual elements need to be embraced to improve preparedness. Taking a social perspective of writing, this qualitative study explores the situated nature of workplace writing experienced by vocational college graduates. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 vocational college graduates and four line managers at five private sector companies in Oman over a period of eight months. Additionally, 29 of the graduates’ workplace texts were analysed. Data reveal that socio-contextual elements strongly influence writing practices surrounding the text. By highlighting this key contextual element, we suggest that to better equip learners for workplace writing, ESP course designers need to address the text-context relationship and contextualised nature of written genres. This paper studies engagement in English-medium research articles across two disciplines, linguistics and economics, and two linguacultural backgrounds, Anglophone and Czech, in order to explore how disciplinary and linguacultural considerations affect the choice, frequency and distribution of engagement markers in the construal of persuasive academic discourse. The contrastive analysis applying Hyland & Jiang's (2016) modified model of engagement is carried on a corpus of 60 refereed research articles published in international and local academic journals within these disciplines and linguacultural backgrounds.
