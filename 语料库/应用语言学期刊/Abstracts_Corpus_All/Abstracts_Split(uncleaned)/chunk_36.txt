We argue that role modelling may be a highly influential component of the psychological context of second-language acquisition, and conclude by highlighting several valuable areas for future research. This paper examines two forms of listening in relation to racism and the minoritylanguage context in Catalonia. The research is based on a collaboration between twoacademics and RC (Racialised Catalans) which started with initial interviews on theireducational experiences and trajectories in Catalonia. From there, a collaboration betweenthe academics and a inter-cultural, anti-racism group (Junts a pseudonym) emerged .First, we analyse the role of the white listening subject in which RC are discriminatedagainst for a perceived lack of Catalan. Second, we describe how the group made otherslisten through their work. Thus, listening results in a form of 'undecideability' which requireswider society for the possibilities of racial equality. In the highly multicultural workplace of todayâ€™s multinational corporations (MNCs), translating across different cultures becomes a crucial issue. But what precisely counts as culture in the global workplace of the MNC? What does it exactly mean to be able to translate across cultures under the regimes of evaluation adopted by MNCs? In this article, I consider these questions through a discussion of the corporate discourse of diversity management, in which the cultural diversity of the workforce is understood as a resource for maximizing profit.
