Specifically, this research compared diagnostic and final in-class writing produced by 30 students who received explicit noun phrase instruction and also conducted a separate analysis of 30 papers by writers who did not experience such teaching. Since prompts were found to be a mediating factor in previous research, this variable was also considered in the analysis. The results demonstrate that while both groups displayed patterns of development, targeted instruction led to more frequent use of complex noun phrases in general and of noun phrase modifiers associated with advanced stages of syntactic complexity development. Additionally, while prompts had an effect on some noun phrase features, overall trends in development remained unchanged. These findings support claims from previous research that explicit teaching of complex noun phrases may benefit writersâ€™ syntactic complexity development. Due to the paucity of attention to research article (RA) abstracts, particularly from a diachronic perspective, this study investigates the changes in the representation of authorial presence through first person pronouns in RA abstracts, with data sampled from four applied linguistics journals between 1990 and 2019. The findings indicate that the representation of authorial presence tends to be shaped by the number of authors. Overall, co-authors intrude into their abstracts more frequently than single authors. In the most recent two decades, single authors are inclined to project their author persona as individuals. However, in the 2010s, both types of authors tend to conceal their presence in abstracts through less frequent use of personal pronouns.
