We randomly assigned 66 university students to two groups in terms of the language they were required to use throughout the discussion: the L1 group and the L2 group. Within each group, they formed pairs to talk about a given writing topic, after which they individually finished their writing and completed an online retrospective questionnaire. We compared the writings of the two groups in terms of complexity, accuracy, fluency, content richness, and holistic quality. The results suggested that: 1) the L1 group outperformed the L2 group in lexical complexity, accuracy, and fluency, while there were no between-group differences in other measures; 2) the L1 group overall held more positive views towards the effect of the discussion, especially in terms of the facilitative role of discussion in improving fluency. These findings point to the need of a balanced use of students’ L1 and L2 in L2 writing classrooms. This study examined the linguistic and extra-linguistic sources of speech anxiety of second/foreign language (L2) learners of Chinese through a structural equation modeling approach. Data were collected from 226 L2 learners of Chinese via questionnaires and speaking tests. Three competing models were proposed to understand how linguistic (i.e., speech proficiency) and extra-linguistic (i.e., willingness-to-communicate/WTC, socio-cultural attitudes, speech strategies, and speech self-efficacy) factors jointly influenced learners' L2 Chinese speech anxiety. The results of model comparisons suggested that 1) speaking strategies were the most positive predictor directly contributing to speech anxiety; 2) the other significant direct predictors included WTC, speaking self-efficacy, and speaking proficiency; 3) socio-cultural attitudes had a positive indirect effect on speech anxiety through the mediation of WTC. The study concluded with pedagogical implications on how to ameliorate students’ L2 Chinese speech anxiety in classroom teaching.
