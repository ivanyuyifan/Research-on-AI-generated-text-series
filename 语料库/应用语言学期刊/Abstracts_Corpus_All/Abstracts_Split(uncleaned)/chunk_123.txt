Interviewers shared their WTC-related insights in a follow-up class, providing participants with maximum exposure to the elicited WTC-focused strategies. A key finding was that talk-positive students used a combination of expected behaviours and task-outcome-visualization in combination with ‘resetting’ meta-cognitive strategies to overcome learning difficulties. Furthermore, students reported three approaches to peer—peer strategy sharing: desire for self-improvement, rapprochement with peers, and personal reassurance. In addition to understanding task completion- and communication-difficulties and learning potential WTC-focused strategy resolutions, some individuals reported a change in mind-set and continued to observe their peers' learning-focused behaviours after the study. Thus, this idiodynamic peer—peer approach may be used for ongoing WTC-focused learner development and improved intra-group dynamics. This study accounts for the results obtained from a teaching innovation project called SubESPSKills (Subtitling tasks in the English for Specific Purposes class to improve written production skills) with a control and experimental group of undergraduates taking a course on Business English. The study was conducted during the 2018–2019 academic year at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain. Among our main goals was the improvement of writing production skills in the English for Specific Purposes class. In order to do so, reverse subtitling was used as an audiovisual translation tool to enhance participants’ written skills in a course of Business English (Degree in Commerce). With the aim of using reverse subtitling as a tool for the practice of writing in English as a foreign language, the participants were required to submit a number of activities of written production on topics related to business and commerce.
