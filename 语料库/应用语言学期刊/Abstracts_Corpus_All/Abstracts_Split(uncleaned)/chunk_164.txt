The findings showed that the participants could mine both single words and formulaic sequences in the immediate and the repeat oral task. Yet, while the number of shared words in the repeat oral task was the same as in the immediate oral task, the number of shared formulaic sequences was lower. There was no effect of input repetition on lexical mining in the repeat oral task. Finally, only prior vocabulary knowledge was positively correlated to lexical mining. Pre-service teachers face a number of challenges which might threaten their wellbeing, including negotiating their student and teacher roles, and difficulties in managing their pupils and workload (Day & Gu, 2010). Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they have been confronted with additional challenges resulting from the transition to online learning and teaching, as well as social problems caused by lockdowns. In this study, we explore the wellbeing of six pre-service language teachers through individual interviews conducted during the first wave of the pandemic. The study has two main aims. Firstly, we seek to identify how these pre-service teachers coped with the challenges of becoming a teacher in the context of a major disruption to their wellbeing. Secondly, we aim to contribute to theoretical work in this field by examining their wellbeing from a Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008) perspective to explore the dynamic and complex nature of the construct.
