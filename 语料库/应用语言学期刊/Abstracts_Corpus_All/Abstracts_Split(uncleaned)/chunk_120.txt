A series of question-and-answer activities based on IRS using the peer instruction (PI) is created for helping students promote their learning. A total of 102 university students participated in a quasi-experiment; 52 were assigned to an experimental group and learnt with an IRS-integrated activity, while 50 were in a control group and learnt with a non-IRS activity. The data were gathered using an achievement assessment instrument, a perception questionnaire, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analysed to examine students' learning achievements and learning perceptions. Results show that IRS can effectively promote students’ learning, and foster positive perceptions of learning. Future implementations on IRS-integrated learning activities are thus recommended for educators. The field of language learning strategies (LLS) has grown significantly, experiencing many twists and turns over the years. Consequently, this study takes stock of, and reports on, definitional and conceptual changes, because how we define a concept can greatly affect its impact on teaching and research. We collected 461 journal articles from prominent databases and divided them into three time periods marked by major developments in the field: 1975–1990, 1991–2005, and 2006–2019. We then used content analysis to categorize, code, and explore explicit definitions found in the articles and various corpus-based techniques on the full texts to investigate implicit conceptualizations of LLS within and across these time periods.
