Today, we know little about how massive unidirectional translations from English into other languages influence discourse norms in these languages. The paper discusses relevant research into this important issue. While there are some signs that a new kind of overt translation is gaining ground, suppressing cultural filtering and causing Anglophone norms to ‘shine through’ in translation, other studies show that indigenous discourse norms remain intact. Learning a visual language gives hearing mothers the possibility of participating in their deaf children’s culture. Yet, mothers also grapple with the demands of an unmarked global hearing culture, especially as their children’s deafness becomes mediated by technology and medical intervention, under the guise of progress, social mobility, equity, and inclusion (Lane et al. 1996). Access to spoken English through technological aids supposedly ‘solves’ the perceived ‘problem’ of communication and cultural difference between mother and child. But what is at stake in this process of translation aided by new technologies? I take a critical discourse analytic approach to analyze videotaped interviews with six hearing mothers. Hearing mother interviewees displayed ambivalent shifts in footing, in particular, mode-switches, which, I argue, paralleled the ambiguous subject positions of their deaf children who they perceive as both deaf (without implants) and hearing (with implants).
