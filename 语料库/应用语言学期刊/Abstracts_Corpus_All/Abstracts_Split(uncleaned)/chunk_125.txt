In contrast, Spanish authors were more neutral, focussing largely on statements of contribution and relevance to the zeitgeist. Revealing how different levels of culture (unstated communication principles, knowledge areas, socialisation processes and research assessment policies) affect the inclusion of specific communicative functions demonstrates how social scientistsâ€™ promotional approaches in DC sections are complex and merit further attention. Implications for the teaching of academic writing in English are drawn. Genre analysis has provided many insights into the structure of research articles, but engineering articles have often been grouped with the hard sciences, obscuring their distinctive features. This study reports the development of a research-based curriculum for engineering writing in an English as a lingua franca context, including a published textbook and ancillary materials, during eight years of action research. A new textual analysis method incorporating ideas from genre analysis and argumentation theory, component analysis, was developed to allow students to describe the structure of research articles. The instructor and students, with background support from their advisors, used this to co-construct an understanding of the prototypical structures of engineering articles. Student input helped clarify the analysis categories, textbook descriptions, and assessments. Component analysis may be useful to writing instructors as a basis for quickly understanding how research articles differ, reducing the time necessary to develop research-based curricula for other fields or genres. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find pure genres in the real world of discourse.
