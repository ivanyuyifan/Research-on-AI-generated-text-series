The study found that students’ perceptions of peer collaboration and personal collaborative behaviors remained stable through the progress of the CW project. However, their feelings towards the CW project revealed fluctuations insofar as they initially felt very positive and motivated to participate but became demotivated as the project progressed due to various factors such as time constraints, group incongruity, and linguistic challenges. They became re-motivated through a growing awareness of satisfying collaborative outcomes and gained a strong sense of achievement. They indicated that they were more confident and prepared to participate in future CW activities. Based on the findings of this study, pedagogical implications are addressed and suggestions are offered for implementing CW in CFL writing classrooms. Lowie and Verspoor (2019) had an unexpected finding in their work Individual Differences and the Ergodicity Problem: The main predictor for proficiency gains in 22 beginning Dutch learners of English over one year was not traditional individual difference (ID) factors, but the degree of variability that occurred over time. We speculate that variability might stand for “investment” as students might strive for an excellent product at one time, but are not able to reach quite the same level the next time. The current paper sets out to see whether the findings can be replicated with a different population and finer-tuned measures. The English writing proficiency of 22 L1 Chinese adults at the university level was measured with 12 texts scored holistically over one academic year. The degree of variability in L2 writing was operationalized as the coefficient of variation (CoV), which was calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean of the L2 writing holistic scores.
