The two overwhelmingly recurrent pronouns we and I performed eight discourse functions, among which low-stakes ones (functions that run relatively low risk of exposing authors to readers’ attacks or challenges) have been favored over high-stakes ones (functions that run relatively high risk of exposing authors to readers’ attacks or challenges). The most recurrent low-stakes function of “Organize the text” and “Describe methods” both exhibit significant diachronic variations in their occurrence in co-authored abstracts, with the former overall increasing while the latter steadily declining. However, no significant variations are observed in the occurrence of these two low-stakes functions in single-authored abstracts. The dominant high-stakes function “State opinions” displays opposite diachronic patterns in its incidence in co-authored and single-authored abstracts -- downward and upward respectively. Plagiarism is a complex issue, torn between theory and practice, expectation and reality, and developmental and ethical concerns. However, in terms of student/teacher perceptions and practices, most plagiarism research has focused on English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) settings, with little to no research into English medium instruction (EMI) in non-Western locales. Therefore, using a combination of Likert scale items, agree/disagree statements, and open-ended questions, we sampled 395 Thai undergraduates and 46 lecturers on their attitudes, beliefs, understandings, and exposure to plagiarism in EMI programs. We also examined the institutional policies of their universities for definitions and punishments related to plagiarism. Results showed that both groups framed plagiarism as ethically wrong and broadly understood what constituted plagiarism. However, there was a clear disconnect between institutional policies on plagiarism and actual practices.
