Results demonstrate the resilience of prescriptive/purist language attitudes and the tension inherent between these beliefs (albeit couched within positive heritage language attitudes) and speakers’ actual bilingualism. Further, they show that the ideologies of individual agency can paradoxically contribute to the imposition of deficit sociolinguistic identities on later-generation speakers and curtail their language use. The study renders visible connections between ideologies of language, identity, and agency and demonstrates how their reproduction within families and communities circumscribes later-generation heritage speakers’ linguistic identities and behavior. This article is in three parts. Part 1 describes translation in relation to intercultural communication. Part 2 characterizes translation as intercultural communication designed to achieve intercultural understanding, which can be reached along two different paths: overt and covert translation (House 1977). These translation types and the notion of a ‘cultural filter’ are characterized. Part 3 addresses the impact globalization and global English is having on translation today. Today, we know little about how massive unidirectional translations from English into other languages influence discourse norms in these languages. The paper discusses relevant research into this important issue.
