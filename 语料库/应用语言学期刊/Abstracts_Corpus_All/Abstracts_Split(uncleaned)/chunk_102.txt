While there are some signs that a new kind of overt translation is gaining ground, suppressing cultural filtering and causing Anglophone norms to ‘shine through’ in translation, other studies show that indigenous discourse norms remain intact. Learning a visual language gives hearing mothers the possibility of participating in their deaf children’s culture. Yet, mothers also grapple with the demands of an unmarked global hearing culture, especially as their children’s deafness becomes mediated by technology and medical intervention, under the guise of progress, social mobility, equity, and inclusion (Lane et al. 1996). Access to spoken English through technological aids supposedly ‘solves’ the perceived ‘problem’ of communication and cultural difference between mother and child. But what is at stake in this process of translation aided by new technologies? I take a critical discourse analytic approach to analyze videotaped interviews with six hearing mothers. Hearing mother interviewees displayed ambivalent shifts in footing, in particular, mode-switches, which, I argue, paralleled the ambiguous subject positions of their deaf children who they perceive as both deaf (without implants) and hearing (with implants). This study brings to light the complex role technology and ‘cochlear implant culture’ play in shaping an instrumentalized view of language with the objective of participating in local and global hearing culture. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR), rooted in the more established tradition of Community-Based Participatory Research (Deeb-Sossa 2019), seeks to empower patients in determining the most appropriate healthcare options by including and amplifying their voices in every aspect of the research process.
