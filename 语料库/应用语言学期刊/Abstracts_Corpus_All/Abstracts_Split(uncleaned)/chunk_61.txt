Couched within the construct of Cognitive Discourse Function (CDF) (Dalton-Puffer, 2016), we analyze 6 two-hour lessons delivered by three lecturers in history. In line with the competences set out by the Spanish Ministry and the Department of History at the University of the Basque Country (Spain) for the history degree, this analysis allows us to examine how cognitive functions are operationalized in real classroom language. The study aims to analyze whether CDFs are instrumental in the acquisition of competences in history. Our findings reveal that teachers frequently use complex CDFs by combining different types of discourse functions to achieve their communicative goals and pave the way for studentsâ€™ acquisition of history competences. We conclude by putting forward some refinements and specifications of CDFs in terms of what is required by history as a discipline. Even with the popularity of genre-based teaching, conceptual blind spots and knowledge gaps still exist regarding the place of language in the ESP genre-based approach to teaching writing. Examining the literature carefully, I explicate in this article how lexico-grammatical features have been attended to in the theoretical tenets, textbooks, and classroom practices in the ESP genre-based approach, an approach that is appealing to writing instructors and ESP practitioners. Regarding theoretical tenets, I unpack the inseparability of lexico-grammatical features from rhetorical organizations or rhetorical contexts in the ESP genre-based approach. With regard to textbooks, I demonstrate the intensive and expert attention to lexico-grammatical features in graduate-level ESP genre-based textbooks. I explore the possibility of using the inductive, guided discovery approach to develop undergraduate-level teaching materials that focus on common, unique, and important lexico-grammatical features.
