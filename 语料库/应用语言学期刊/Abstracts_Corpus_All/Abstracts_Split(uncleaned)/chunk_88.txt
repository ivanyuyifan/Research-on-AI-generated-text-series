Adopting a quasi-experimental design, this study was implemented in two intact university English classes, with a treatment group receiving four rounds of comprehensive WCF, while no feedback was offered to a comparison group. The posttest and delayed posttest results revealed that such WCF helped the treatment group improve their writing accuracy and fluency statistically significantly and retain the positive effects in the delayed posttest, while it did not enhance their syntactic complexity. The comparison group did not statistically significantly improve their writing accuracy, syntactic complexity, or fluency. To elicit participants’ perceptions of comprehensive WCF effects on their linguistic performance, we administered a follow-up open-ended questionnaire with all the treatment-group participants after the posttest. The qualitative findings generally echoed and shed light on the quantitative results. We conclude our study with a discussion of its implications. In this ‘Researching EAP Practice!’ paper, I reflect on the experience of embedding learner-initiated enquiry into an in-sessional EAP course and argue that the process can be viewed as a continuous exploration of learners’ needs. First, I explain the rationale for adopting Exploratory Practice (EP)-a form of practitioner research-to position EAP undergraduates at a UK university as learner-researchers. I then reveal why our EAP team harnessed EP’s central process of ‘puzzling’ to develop personalised research agendas and encourage student engagement, practitioner collaboration and novel learning. Finally, I outline how academic and practitioner research in EAP combined with our professional development experiences shaped the approach taken.
