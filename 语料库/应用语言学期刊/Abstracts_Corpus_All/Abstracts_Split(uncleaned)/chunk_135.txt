This study uses the appraisal system developed in systemic functional linguistics to investigate the use of evaluative language for demonstrating topic significance in RCT Introductions. The results indicate the existence of three strands of evaluation targeting the disorder under investigation with reference to its: (i) symptoms/effects; (ii) affected population, and (iii) treatment. The findings of this study carry important pedagogical implications for teaching novice medical researchers. The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) narratives in corporate annual reports (ARs) provide critical information for investors and financial analysts. This study reports results of a comparative multi-dimensional analysis of the linguistic features of MD&A narratives in the ARs produced by Chinese and American public companies on the 2015 Fortune Global 500 list. Our results show that, compared to the MD&A narratives produced by American companies, those produced by Chinese companies are more narrative, less explicit in expressing the authorsâ€™ views, and less technical, abstract and formal; they also have fewer features of on-line informational elaboration. The linguistic features of the MD&A narratives are not significantly affected by company size or profitability in the case of American companies, but they vary significantly by company size in the case of Chinese companies. Our findings contribute to a systematic understanding of the genre features of MD&A narratives in ARs of Chinese and American companies and have useful implications for Business English pedagogy in the context of China. The artist's statement is a unique genre that provides a written description of an artist's creative work. Usually produced by the artists themselves, the artist's statement accompanies exhibitions, funding applications, or more recently the work presented on an artist's website.
