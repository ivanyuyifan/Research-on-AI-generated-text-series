For systems with irregular (asymmetric and positively-negatively alternating) constraints being imposed/removed during system operation, there is no uniformly applicable control method. In this work, a control design framework is established for uncertain pure-feedback systems subject to the aforementioned constraints. By introducing a novel transformation function and with the help of auxiliary constraining boundaries, the original output-constrained system is augmented to unconstrained one. Unknown nonlinearity is approximated by neural networks (NNs) with not only neural weight updating but also activation online adjustment. The resultant control scheme is able to deal with constraints imposed or removed at some time moments during system operation without the need for altering control structure. When applied to high-speed trains, the developed control scheme ensures position tracking under speed constraints, simulation demands, and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.
