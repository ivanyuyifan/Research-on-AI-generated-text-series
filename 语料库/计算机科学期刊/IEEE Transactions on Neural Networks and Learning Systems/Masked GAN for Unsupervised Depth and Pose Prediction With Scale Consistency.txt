Previous work has shown that adversarial learning can be used for unsupervised monocular depth and visual odometry (VO) estimation, in which the adversarial loss and the geometric image reconstruction loss are utilized as the mainly supervisory signals to train the whole unsupervised framework. However, the performance of the adversarial framework and image reconstruction is usually limited by occlusions and the visual field changes between the frames. This article proposes a masked generative adversarial network (GAN) for unsupervised monocular depth and ego-motion estimations. The MaskNet and Boolean mask scheme are designed in this framework to eliminate the effects of occlusions and impacts of visual field changes on the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, respectively. Furthermore, we also consider the scale consistency of our pose network by utilizing a new scale-consistency loss, and therefore, our pose network is capable of providing the full camera trajectory over a long monocular sequence. Extensive experiments on the KITTI data set show that each component proposed in this article contributes to the performance, and both our depth and trajectory predictions achieve competitive performance on the KITTI and Make3D data sets.
