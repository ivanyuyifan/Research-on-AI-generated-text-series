The IoT ecosystem envisions a new world fully integrated by smart devices exchanging data to enable more automated, accurate, and timely decisions. Nonetheless, this idealized scenario may be only implemented if the system database allow smart devicesâ€™ transactions to be efficiently processed and security is guaranteed. To tackle this challenge, this paper then analyzes three Blockchain integrated architectures, covering an assemblage of different popular IoT-application scenarios. The performance evaluation is based on analytical queueing models, simulations, and theoretical discussion. The results show that efficiency and security requirements may be met when the Blockchain system is suitably configured, mainly observing a trade-off between data integrity and response time. In this sense, our main contribution is to yield valuable subsidies which can act as guidance for the development of real IoT-ecosystem projects. At last, general conclusions and directions for further research close this paper.
