This article investigates an adaptive finite-time neural control for a class of strict feedback nonlinear systems with multiple objective constraints. In order to solve the main challenges brought by the state constraints and the emergence of finite-time stability, a new barrier Lyapunov function is proposed for the first time, not only can it solve multiobjective constraints effectively but also ensure that all states are always within the constraint intervals. Second, by combining the command filter method and backstepping control, the adaptive controller is designed. What is more, the proposed controller has the ability to avoid the “singularity” problem. The compensation mechanism is introduced to neutralize the error appearing in the filtering process. Furthermore, the neural network is used to approximate the unknown function in the design process. It is shown that the proposed finite-time neural adaptive control scheme achieves a good tracking effect. And each objective function does not violate the constraint bound. Finally, a simulation example of electromechanical dynamic system is given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time control strategy.
